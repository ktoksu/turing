# Machine Learning Playground

In the context of reading *The Master Algorithm* by Pedro Domingos (a prof at UW), I want to try out each of what he calls the five "tribes" (schools of thought) of machine learning:

> **Symbolists:**  use **inverse deduction** (combine philosophy, psychology and logic)

> **Connectionists:**  use **backpropagation** (combine neuroscience and physics)

> **Evolutionaries:**  use **genetic programming** (combine genetics and evolutionary biology)

> **Bayesians:**  use **Bayesian inference** (combine probabilistic inference, statistics)

> **Analogizers:**  use **support vector machines** (combine similarity judgments, psychology, mathematical optimization

According to Domingos, each tribe has its master algorithm, "a general-purpose learner that can in principle be applied to any domain."

However, Domingos favors Markov logic networks in trying to create a "universal learner," so let's also add that to the list:

> **Domingos:**  uses **Markov logic networks**
