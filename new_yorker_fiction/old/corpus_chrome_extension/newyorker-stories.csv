Chicken Hill	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/chicken-hill			"She didn’t know what had possessed her to participate in such a thing. A little boy had been run over by a sheriff’s deputy, and there was a memorial fund-raiser at the Barbed Wire, a biker bar in a somewhat alarming part of town, and Ruth had gone and bought a beer and put thirty dollars into an empty terrarium, for funeral expenses. The place was loud and crowded, and she was given a plate with a tamale on it. Outside, someone had brought a pony and was providing pony rides for the dead boy’s friends. No one spoke to her directly, but she learned that the boy’s name was Hector and that his father was suing the sheriff’s department."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, Big Uncle, I swear.” I was suddenly afraid, but then he gave me a wide smile and sat down again in a single motion, tired and old."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"We shook our heads no, though we both did."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, sir.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Our ancestors were fierce archers,” Big Uncle said. “I don’t know where we learned it. From the Mongols, probably. In the old days, there were men in the Lee clan who galloped on horseback and shot arrows so straight they could hit the hole in a dangling coin.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"We dragged the boat up a little ways, and I uncoiled the rope and tied it to a sapling."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"We didn’t know what to say, because any answer would have been wrong. If we said yes, we’d be admitting that we had smelled his rotting flesh before the cigarette smoke, and if we said no we’d be saying that the smell of smoke didn’t cover the odor of his foot, which he had wrapped in a makeshift bandage of dry moss, with only a few strands of straw to bind it together."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Ya! ” Yongsu called after me. “Careful!” I heard his footfalls catching up to me as I ran along the trail through patches of light and shadow, feeling the texture of the ground change under me as I trod on pine needles, then pebbles, then dry earth."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“An inauspicious number,” Big Uncle said. “Sa. The death number. The snake number. You know, ungh?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Stop!” the shape said.
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“That’s right.”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"In a few moments, Yongsu was at my side, tugging at my shirt to make me stop, but I pulled away and continued to run in the direction of the sound. We came around a sharp bend in the trail and squinted into the sun that shone through a gap in the trees. A huge silhouette stood before us, massive and black to our sun-blind eyes."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Now, why do you suppose this was? Why would I remember this part of the night years and years later? That woman was like a Heavenly Maiden, but I know she was the ghost of a virgin who had died a very long time ago. Probably when the Chinese or the Mongols were in our country. She must have been a princess, with all that jewelry and those servants. She must have been waiting for centuries for some man to come along and release her into the next world with the power of his yang."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“When I woke up, it was past dawn. The sun was above the horizon, and a streak of light was shining on my face. I sat there for the longest time, because I thought the ghost had tied me up to that tree, but then, when I finally had the strength and the courage to look around, I saw that I was sitting against the tree as if I were tied to it, but there were only a few dried-up strands of grass around me. Not even enough to weave into a bad straw rope."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Do you swear?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“We have to find the arrows. What else can we do?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Ah.” He moved the half-smoked Camel to the other side of his mouth.
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Yongsu won’t be there with the boat. You’re going to have to swim across. Can you do that?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I sat at the edge of the fire and took the spitted bird from Big Uncle. I realized that he had cooked only two birds, and I looked from mine to his."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“The smell bother you?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“It’s been a long time, ungh? Pull that arrow out and follow me. Have you brought me anything to eat?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Big Uncle hobbled back up the trail, and Yongsu followed, leaving me with the arrow. The tip had punctured the bark of the tree and buried itself so far in the trunk that I had to grasp the arrow shaft with both hands—as close to the tip as possible for fear of breaking it—and move it gingerly back and forth until it dislodged. By the time I had it out, intact, Yongsu and Big Uncle were out of sight, and I had to run as quickly as I could to find them."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Like our Hong Gil-dong, ungh?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"As I tightened my abdominal muscles and pressed my palms together to get my blood flowing, I noticed a small sooty teapot quietly steaming over the fire."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“And there were two little scars on my foot. It didn’t look much worse than a couple of mosquito bites or maybe a couple of pimples, but that’s what festered later and spread up and down my foot. Even with the best Chinese medicine, it never really healed. Everyone says it was a snakebite, but that’s not true."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, I slept. I’m half asleep all the time, so the night doesn’t make much difference. Any dreams?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I shouldn’t have left the trail. That was a mistake. Before I knew it, I was in the middle of the woods, and the light, which had been right in front of me, suddenly blinked out, and I was in the pitch-black night. I couldn’t see anything. I was reaching out around myself so the tree branches wouldn’t scratch out my eyes."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I was thinking about your bow, Big Uncle.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“You’re going?” I said.
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Look,” I said to Yongsu. There were rags draped over the lower branches of a tree to dry in the sun, and they were still discolored—yellow and red—with what must have been the pus and blood oozing from Big Uncle’s sores."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Sometimes, when I get a little drunk, I can remember even more about how beautiful everything was, but then, when I’m sober again, I forget. But it was beautiful. She was the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, and coupling with her was wonderful. I think I can remember, sometimes, that we rutted like animals without all those servants around."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Hello, Big Uncle,” I said."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Do you think we’ll be able to find Big Uncle?” I asked.
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“It wasn’t until years later that I remembered what happened to me after I was blinded by that light. And it was in a dream. I remembered it in a dream. A beautiful woman came out of that light. She was dressed in a white costume in the Chinese style. The fabric was like the finest silk, so white it was like silver. She had long black hair and very big eyes—round eyes, almost Western. She told me to come with her, and I understood her though she didn’t seem to speak. I went into that light, and then I found myself on a high Chinese-style bed with no bed mat under me. The woman’s servants were standing around me, looking down at me. There were shiny silver ornaments and decorations everywhere. Beautiful things that looked like jewelry and weapons and eating utensils. The lamp they shined down on me was brighter than the sun. White light was floating everywhere like flour dust, and the beautiful woman climbed up on the bed, on top of me, and, right in front of her servants, she took off her clothes and pushed herself down onto me. I thought my penis would burst, but she was slightly cold, not like a Korean woman. It was almost impossible to feel anything with all those servants watching me, but somehow I managed to squirt my seed into her, and then everything grew dark again."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Yongsu started up the trail, but I ran ahead of him, shouting “Big Uncle! Big Uncle!” until I thought I heard him reply."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I don’t know much about those Taoist things,” I said."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“No, Big Uncle.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“What’s the matter? I gave you the small one?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“It was a wooden bow, Big Uncle. They called them longbows, and they could shoot arrows that could pierce armor.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I looked out across the flat expanse of the river-become-a-lake, recalling the last time I had been here—the gentle sound of the current, the clear water more transparent than air, flowing icy cold under the boat, and the pebbles, white and gray and black, slick and wet, so distant and yet so close, as the shadow of the boat slipped above them, rippling the bright-blue reflection of the sky. Even the air was clearer back then, without this invisible mist which seemed almost a mental pollution. How could they give up the old river for this murky green plane on which even the reflections looked stagnant? All the old channels must have been clogged with algae and the sort of scum that collects on a dead pond. You could smell the faint rot as the oars disturbed the surface. The creak and the rhythm made me think of voices—and I could almost hear them, nearly as loud as the gurgling sound of the oars dipping into the water—until Yongsu stopped rowing and we butted against the shore."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"That was five years ago. The water was so clear back then that it seemed only a few palm widths deep, shallow enough for me to reach down and touch the pebbles that rippled in the play of light and the shadow of the boat. Now, when I looked over the side, the water was a foggy green color, and after the first few feet I couldn’t see the bottom. “What happened to the water?” I said. “There’s something green in it.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I ate, too, and despite my queasiness at the clump of black crow feathers I saw in the underbrush, the meat tasted wonderful, its gamy tang cut by the salt. My face warmed by the fire, and my stomach rumbling even as I ate, I tore my bird to shreds and sucked at the bones until they were dry. It was dark when we were done, and we passed the jug of water back and forth to wash down the last scraps of crow meat."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Yongsu and I launched the flat-bottomed boat from a muddy part of the river I didn’t recognize. It seemed the bank of the river had moved much closer to the village, though I knew it hadn’t rained much that year. We took our places and, as Yongsu pulled the oars, I scanned the far shore for a good place to land—a landmark that Yongsu could aim for to counter the current."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Well, it’s a story. Like some folktale. But everyone’s life is like a story, isn’t it? From a long, long time ago.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“We used to call this place Skullhead Cave,” Big Uncle said, “because it looks like the top of a skull, and the two openings are like half-buried eye sockets. But now no one even knows what it’s called anymore. And why do you suppose I live in this cave?” He stared at us for a moment. “Don’t you think I’d live in a house if I could?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I’ll come back in the morning. You’re going to be out here all night looking for arrows in the trees, stupid.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Now, that’s a good story,” Big Uncle said after a moment. “This Ro Bing Ho sounds like a good man. Did he come from a family of warriors or farmers?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Well, since you plucked that other arrow this morning, let’s say you found five. Now, five is an interesting number. O. It sounds like the sign of the horse, or a mistake, or a word for anguish. O-da. You have come. O-do. You have awakened.” He ran each arrow through his fingers, checking to see if their shafts had split, if their feathers had come undone. “So what do you think, Insu-ya?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Then the light blinked on again somewhere to my right. Then off again, and it reappeared somewhere to my left. And that’s when I knew it was a goblin light or a ghost. I started thinking of all those terrible stories about the woodcutters who see the lights at night and then get enticed by fox demons and have their life energy sucked out. I started running back toward the trail, or where I thought it should be, but the light kept appearing in front of me, and then I would change directions and run headlong into a tree or fall into a hole."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I searched for Big Uncle’s arrows until the light waned and I could no longer discern the colors in the shadows. I was terribly frustrated at first, impatient and even angry as I waded through patches of high grass, cutting my flesh, or picked my way through tangles of shrubbery because I thought I had glimpsed a yellow feather on the other side. At one point, the heat of the day seeping into my sweaty body, I rested under a tree, half dozing in its cool shade and the breeze that came across the flat green river. In a momentary lapse into real sleep, I had the briefest of dreams: I was sitting with my back against a tree, but it was nighttime, and it was raining so hard that not even the branches could protect me; water sluiced down on me each time the wind shifted, and I tried to huddle into myself, chilled like the blade of a knife that could cut me to the bone. I was going to die, and the fear and the cold woke me up into the slightly thick and groggy heat of late afternoon. It must have been the heat, I thought. I dreamed of the opposite thing even though in my dream I’d been doing the same thing—looking for Big Uncle’s arrows. I resumed my search and, while the light held, I happened on a place where Big Uncle’s aim must have been especially bad. I found four arrows."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"We didn’t know what to say to Big Uncle. We had never heard him so bitter before, so crude and angry."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“No, Big Uncle.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“No, sir. I was just wondering—”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Ah, fuck it! We shouldn’t have let him talk to us like that. I’m not staying out here in the woods to fetch some damned arrows for the old man.” He shoved the water jug into my belly and stalked off down the trail to the river."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, Big Uncle!” we called back."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Now, Little Uncle didn’t tell you that part of the story, did he?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Insu-ya,” he said."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, Big Uncle.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“What do you think of me saving them the trouble, ungh? They won’t even have to roll the rock back for me, since I’m living in my own cave shack. But maybe the animals will get in and eat my shrivelled corpse before they get me. Wouldn’t that be a shame?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Let’s have some cha before you go,” Big Uncle said without looking at me. “I would offer you coffee, which is what Yankees do, I suppose, but I’m fresh out.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"My nose was beginning to fill, and the pressure in my head told me that I should kick up. For some reason, I felt I had been there before—right there—or would be again. Suddenly I wanted to look around to see if I could see myself looking at me, but the feeling that gave me was so strange that I shook my head, releasing bubbles that showed me which way was up. I slowly raised my sluggish arms, moving them up against the unexpectedly fierce resistance of the water, and then arced them back down again as I gave a violent scissor kick. Green light. Green shadow. Intermediate greens in infinite gradations, subtle and distinct, as numerous as all the names of God. Upward, at the surface, a dark, irregular silhouette with a sharp tail protruding, like the tail of an angular manta ray—it was my raft of clothes, and as I raced my own rising bubbles toward it I thought I glimpsed, just for a second, out of the corner of my eye, a giant green carp beneath me, flicking its broad tail in the very periphery of my vision. ?"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"It was bitter and soothing, and the steam warmed my face. I sipped a little at a time, holding the can between my palms when it had cooled enough not to burn me. “Why do you say dreams are our real life?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“How will I get across the river if you take the boat?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I added the wood and handed him a long splinter, burning at the end like a match, and he lit one of the Camels I had given him. He seemed ready to withdraw; I could see him sitting there, gazing into the fire and thinking his thoughts as if I were not even there, breathing deeply through his nose, exhaling long plumes of smoke, black eyes glinting in the red-and-yellow firelight. Had I not been there, perhaps he would have spoken to himself or sat in some kind of trance, talking with his spirits and his dreams. Had I not been there, he might have sung himself to sleep with the songs from his childhood, the ones his mother and his aunts sang for him on warm summer nights. Had I not been there, he might have wept with sadness or shouted out his anger at the family that had driven him across the river to live like a Taoist hermit, and in the momentary quiet of his cigarette smoking I wished I weren’t there in body but looking down on Big Uncle instead, watching over him from above, the way his tutelary spirit might from the other world."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“If both of you had come back? Well, then, I suppose you’d be fighting over the one, ungh?” He laughed and tore a piece of meat from the breast of his to dab in the salt."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“We all know.” Big Uncle lit a cigarette and sucked on it with the same motion he used to sip his can of tea. “Now go, because you’re going to be hungry, and I have nothing to feed you. When you come back to see me again, bring me some coffee and something good to eat.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Say what’s on your mind now,” Big Uncle said. “At times like this, you should let the thoughts leap off your tongue. You don’t want to be regretful.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Aigo, you unmannered fools.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Quiet!” Yongsu said. “I hear footsteps. It’s someone limping.”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“I don’t remember.”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“What’s good, Big Uncle?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"When we were out of earshot, Yongsu smacked me on the shoulder and said, “Now what are we going to do, ungh?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Ya, it feels like I’ll live awhile now,” Big Uncle said, slipping the extra cigarette back into the pack and then putting the pack into his vest pocket almost unconsciously. He lit the cigarette and took a deep first drag, savoring the smoke in his lungs before blowing it in a long plume at his gangrenous foot. “Helps cover the smell, ungh?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Listen,” Big Uncle said. “You two go out into the woods and fetch me five of my arrows, and I’ll tell you the story. It’s going to take you a while, so I’ll have something good to eat waiting for you when you get back. Understood?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Where did you get it? Where did you learn how to shoot it?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I did my best,” I said. “I’m sorry I only found four arrows.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I was wondering about your foot,” I said."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I stopped there and watched Yongsu disappear as the trail descended sharply and veered to the right. In a few moments, I could no longer hear the heavy crunch of his footfalls, and the woods grew so quiet I thought I could make out the sound of blood rushing in my head."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"We had come up from Bupyeong on a lark. Yongsu had got into some trouble and needed to avoid his dropout friends. I’d recently moved back to Korea after two years away in America and Germany, where my father’s duty stations had taken him. I’d begun skipping school, and since I hadn’t missed any classes yet that week, I had decided to play hooky for a couple of days. Neither of us had been out in the country in a long time, so we had come to pay a visit to Little Uncle and Big Uncle, who liked us and wouldn’t mind keeping a secret. But when we’d arrived in Sambong-ni, the previous night, we’d learned that the gangrene in Big Uncle’s old foot injury had come back. This time the stench was so bad that the family had sent him across the river to the old cave. Little Uncle told us that we had to go and see him, because everyone was worried that Big Uncle might die this time."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“No, sir,” Yongsu said as I struggled to pull the arrow out."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“My, you’ve gotten yourself quite dirty,” Big Uncle said when I returned to his camp with the arrows and the water jug. He had a small fire going, and he had skewered a couple of small birds, which were slowly browning above the flames. I was glad I had been upwind all day, because the moment I smelled the cooking my stomach clenched with hunger and my mouth filled with saliva."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“It reminds me of a book I read about an outlaw named Robin Hood,” I said. “He lived in a secret camp in the woods, and his bow was as tall as a man.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Who do you listen to? Your Big Uncle or your Little Uncle? Who’s older? Does it look like I’ve lost my mind and become a child again?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“No, sir. I can’t smell it now. I found your wrappings this morning.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“You should always remember your dreams, Insu-ya. Dreams are your real life. It’s a shame if you don’t remember it.” Big Uncle turned to face me, wide awake. His face had none of the puffiness of someone who had been asleep; it was drawn tight, the wrinkles fine and shallow until he smiled. He lifted the teapot off the arched stick that kept it well above the fire, and he poured me an old C-ration can full of Japanese green tea swimming with leaf scraps. “The Japs are awful, but they make a fine tea, ungh?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"As Yongsu and I froze and caught our breath, the dark silhouette shifted, looking momentarily like a giant black crane before bending into a more humble shape to approach us, grumbling under his breath. “It’s Yongsu,” he said, finally. “What reason do you have to be up here? And who’s that?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Hello, Big Uncle,” Yongsu said. “I’ve come with Insu.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, sir.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Did you sleep well, Big Uncle?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, Big Uncle,” we said."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“There’s no current since they put up the hydroelectric dam downstream.” Yongsu twitched his head in that direction. “They finished it two years ago. Ever since, the river’s been high all year and full of that algae. Fisheries all over the place now, raising carp, because they like that dirty bottom water.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I don’t know,” I said. I had no idea what he meant by the numbers and their sounds in Korean. All I knew was that Koreans were as superstitious about the number four as Americans were about thirteen. Buildings didn’t have a fourth floor, and most Korean locker rooms had sequences that jumped from three to five, thirteen to fifteen, and thirty-nine to fifty."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Big Uncle made a sweeping gesture around us. “This is all a dream,” he said. “When you die and move on, you forget it just like you forget dreams. And yet this is where you should have learned all your karmic lessons. What a shame to forget.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I leapt into the warm water just behind a little raft I had made for my clothes, and, still submerged, slowly rising from the depths of my plunge, I opened my eyes and found myself suspended in the very center of a frightening sphere of green nothingness. Below me the greenness grew darker and darker, by imperceptible degrees, into a murky blackness, and above me it grew suddenly lighter into the rippling clarity of the surface. But all around, receding into a darkness that was never quite black, an indeterminate green fog; in every direction, the unknown; things lurking just beyond the threshold of vision, where sense became imagination. There was nothing in that river that could harm me, but that instant of perception so terrified me that I would never again swim in open water without believing that something waited, just beyond the range of my vision, to drag me down until the light above me turned as dark as the green-black nothingness below."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			We nodded dumbly.
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“The air’s fresh,” Yongsu said. “From what Little Uncle said, we can just track him by the smell.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Bury me where this arrow falls.” And he let the arrow fly with a loud whoosh of air torn by string and wood, and the arrow blurred high up into the blackness. If Big Uncle had told me then that he had hit the eye of the moon, I would have believed him. The arrow was gone. He lowered the bow to look at me, his eyes flashing with cold flame brighter than the fire."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I thought someone was out there, so I called out to him. ‘Yeoboseyo! Who’s out there? Is anyone out there?’ No answer. Then I thought maybe it was someone who had got injured, so I started into the woods to find him."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Crossing the River Jordan!” Yongsu sang out, parodying our Christian aunt’s favorite hymn. I must have looked alarmed when he brought me out of my reverie, and I worried that he had read the thoughts behind my expression, but he just broke into laughter. “We arrived!” he said. “Here we are in the other world.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Let’s eat. I’m as hungry as you are. Here.” Big Uncle unfolded a small square of paper full of sea salt and poured some onto my palm. “No spice, so this will have to do.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“It was easy to walk. The moon was out. It wasn’t full, but there was enough light to see the trail where it was good. I was feeling fine, because I’d had a good time at the celebration. I wasn’t thinking of ghosts at all when I first saw the light. It was a little light in the distance. That’s what it looked like—a lamp in the woods or a candle in the window of someone’s house, something small and bright only because it was so dark."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“They didn’t ride.”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Good. Now go.” Big Uncle motioned as if to dust me away, and I walked slowly down the trail, trying to remember what he had told me."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Then I heard it. Someone crawling along the path, barely moving. It was still far away, but I could make it out—the sound of an injured man. “He must have fallen,” I said. “It sounds like he’s hurt.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I expected you to come up here with an A-frame jige to carry me back down to the river. Now, that would have been an odd twist on the story, ungh?” He smiled, enjoying himself."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, Big Uncle.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Ya, I haven’t done this in a long time,” Yongsu said, flipping some water into the air. “You remember the last time you were out on this river?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Big Uncle took the arrows with a nod. He didn’t bother asking about Yongsu, so I didn’t mention him, either."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Robin Hood robbed the rich people and gave the money to the peasants. When he knew he was about to die, he shot an arrow out of his window and told his most loyal follower to bury him where it fell.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Insu? Ya, you’ve grown like a bean sprout. All that good food in America.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"We couldn’t stop. We tried to go back the way we had come, but then we heard a loud thump, and a quivering arrow shaft seemed to sprout out of a tree to block our way. The bright feathers trembled in the sunlight, and we heard a wild beating that might have been the wings of an escaping bird or the pounding of our hearts."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“No, Big Uncle.” Because I felt so uncomfortable, I took the carton of cigarettes out of my jacket. I had brought them to give to him before we left, but I presented them to him now, holding them politely with both hands. “Here, Big Uncle. Please enjoy these.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I was terribly stiff myself in the morning, waking just before dawn. Big Uncle had kept the fire burning low to keep us warm; he had dug himself a small hip hole and curled around the periphery of the stones, letting me use his green U.S. Army blanket on the cot. Even so, I was cold, with an ache that didn’t go away until I had struggled to my feet and stretched a few times to get my blood moving. All night long, I had awakened at intervals when the wind shifted and carried the stench of Big Uncle’s foot in my direction. Even the strong smell of the smoky wood, which Big Uncle must have picked just for my sake, couldn’t mask the odor of decay, and in the morning dampness it bore a subtle touch of sewage mixed with the rot."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“And that’s why I don’t ever regret having this wound on my foot. It was the price I had to pay for my enjoyment, and I will have to keep paying it until I go into the next world. But when I coupled with that ghost woman my penis was like a gidung, and my seed gushed like a waterfall."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Big Uncle tossed another piece of wood onto the fire and yawned. He put out the Camel by rolling its shaft against a piece of wood so that only the ash and the burning tip fell off, and then he wet a thumb and forefinger with his saliva and doused the remaining fibres of tobacco before placing the butt behind his right ear. Beyond the flickering boundary of light, the night sounds suddenly grew louder, until Big Uncle cleared his throat and spat his phlegm into the flames, where it made a sizzling noise. “Ro Bing Ho,” he said again—I didn’t bother to correct him. “Good.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Ya,” he said. “I haven’t had one of these Camel cigarettes in years. Thanks.” He fumbled around, looking for matches, and then, giving up, simply pulled a thin stick out of the fire pit and blew on it until its tip glowed and burst into a tiny flame. He held the stick in his mouth as if it were a pipe stem while he unwrapped the carton, putting the cellophane under a U.S. Army cot he must have stolen from one of the nearby bases; then he ripped open a pack of the Camels, tapping a couple expertly out onto his palm. “You two smoke?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“When I was young, we used to put the old people out in caves like this to die after they started to go senile. After they shit and pissed in their clothes and couldn’t remember the names of their children, the family would bring them into the mountains and seal them up in a cave with just a little opening for food. And every day they’d come and leave some food, until it stopped disappearing. When they knew the old person was dead, they’d wait a few more days, just to be sure, and then they’d open up the cave and take the body out for a good funeral and a good burial. Everyone would mourn, crying and sobbing as if the old person had died in some tragic way, but secretly they’d all be relieved."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“And how did they use them on horseback?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“It even sounds different,” I said."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			I nodded. “It was getting dark under the trees.”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Now tell me why you came up here, ungh? You didn’t come up all by yourselves just to visit me, now, did you?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Did Little Uncle send you to bring me back with you? Did you bring a jige?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yeah, he lives around here,” Yongsu said. “He can’t get far with that crippled foot, and he’s been sick for a while. Maybe he’s looking for food or some medicinal herbs.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, Big Uncle.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“The nights are long if you’re the thoughtful sort,” Big Uncle said. “So tell me what you’re thinking about.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“What story, sir?” I said."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“Throw some more wood onto the fire and light me a twig for a cigarette.”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Then go fetch the arrows, and bring up some water while you’re at it. Here’s the jug. And when you get back I’ll have some delicious mountain chicken for you.” He tossed a clay jar, wrapped in straw, to Yongsu, and shooed us off. We walked a little way down the trail before he called out, “Ya! Don’t look together. Go in different directions and look up at the lower branches of the trees. That’s where you’ll find the arrows. They should be easy to spot. I dyed the feathers red, yellow, and blue like the one I shot at you.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I don’t know,” I said. “His father was an official in some district, I think, but he was wrongly deposed by an evil adviser to the king. When his father died, Robin Hood had to hide in the forest with a band of outlaws.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“What is it?” he said, reading our expressions. “Little Uncle told you not to fetch arrows for me?”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Swear to me,” he said. “When I’m dead, you’ll find the arrow, and you’ll have them bury me where it lands.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			I walked over to the rags and hesitated. “They’re dry. Should I gather them up?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Better than some charlatan doctor of wind and water,” he said. “Any fool can take a fancy compass and mumble phrases from the Book of Changes. But that Ro Bing Ho had the right idea.” He rose stiffly to his feet, then picked up his bow and one of his precious arrows. I knew what he was about to do, and the thought thrilled me for some reason, though I immediately sensed its terrible consequence."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I must have run around like that for hours. I was a mess. All scratched up, my ankle twisted, my clothes torn like floor rags. Bruises all over my forearms and shins. But I kept running, because I could feel it. It was some female spirit, and it was determined to get me. I had heard stories about the ghosts of dead virgins and how they hunted unwary men at night. That’s what I was afraid of."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I ran and ran, until finally I just didn’t have the strength anymore, and I collapsed against a tree. The light came at me then. It grew brighter and brighter until it was a brilliant blue, and then a blinding white, and I lost consciousness."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“How did he get a bow that big?” Big Uncle asked. “It must be a fantasy.”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“Yes, sir.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Yongsu started up the slope, and I followed, scanning back and forth through the underbrush. It didn’t take long for us to run into a small trail that followed the waterline, and we took that toward the west, into shadowy woods lanced by sunlight. Yongsu seemed oblivious of anything but the trail, but I relaxed my eyes the way Big Uncle had taught me when I was little, and it wasn’t long before I spotted something odd."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"Big Uncle stretched and limbered up his neck, and then he drew the bow, bending the ox horn nearly back on itself against the nocked arrow. He looked directly up into the night, and I followed his gaze to see a circle of blackness ringed by the illuminated bottoms of the tree branches, leaves quietly rustling in the wind and the force of heat from the campfire. How odd, I thought, as I looked up at a domed wall of foliage with a hole in the center. This was what it was like to bend back your neck and stare up at the ceiling of a basilica to see the holy murals of Christ and God and the angels, but out here in the forest that center was lost in a blackness that was not even punctuated by a star, because the light of the campfire had made us night-blind. Now Big Uncle turned four times, once in each direction, and though I thought it impossible to know the cardinal directions at night without the stars as a guide, I sensed that Big Uncle knew the points of the compass exactly."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“I was coming home after some celebration—the hundred-day party for Old Pak’s grandson. It was past sunset, and they told me to stay the night there in that village, but I stubbornly decided to come home over the mountain. There were still wild animals in the woods back then and even rumors of tigers, though no one had seen one since the Japanese came. That’s why people said not to go—because of the tigers—but they were actually afraid of ghosts and goblins and the usual lies."
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"“No,” I said. “Well, we came up for another reason.”"
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			“What about my bow?”
Five Arrows	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/03/five-arrows			"I expected Big Uncle to smoke while he talked, but he just closed his eyes, as if to let the firelight warm his eyelids. He sat with his legs crossed, his bad foot on top, and he told the story into the fire."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"There’s the shy muttering homeless lady, a collector of cans, who hoists her clanging bags on the back of her bicycle and uses the old carriage blocks in front of the grander houses to mount her ride; the waft of her makes me think of the wealthy Southern dames in dark silk who once used those blocks to climb into their carriages, emitting a similarly intimate feminine smell."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"I have mostly stopped caring where I walk, but I try to be at the Duck Pond every night when the Christmas lights, forgotten for weeks now, click off and the pond erupts, the frogs launching into their syncopated song like a nursery school let loose in a room of untuned lutes. Our pair of black swans would shout at the frogs with their brass voices as if to shut them up, but, outnumbered, the birds would soon give up and climb the island in the center of the pond and twine their necks together to sleep. The swans had four cygnets last spring, sweet cheeping puffs that were the delight of my little boys, who tossed dog food at them every day, until one morning, while the swans were distracted by our food, one cygnet gave a choked peep, bobbed, then went down; it came up again but across the pond, in the paws of an otter that ate it in small bites, floating serenely on its back. The otter got one more cygnet before the wildlife service arrived to scoop up the remaining two, but it was later reported in the neighborhood newsletter that the tiny swan hearts had given out in fear. The parent swans floated for months, inconsolable, though perhaps this is a projection, for, since they are both black swans and parents, they are already prefeathered in mourning."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"Because the nights are so cold, I share the streets with few people. There’s a young couple who jog at a pace slightly slower than my fast walk. I follow them, listening to their patter of wedding plans and fights with friends. Once I forgot myself and laughed at something they said and their faces owled, unnerved, back at me, then they trotted faster and took the first turn they found and I let them disappear into the black."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"There’s an elegant, tall woman who walks a Great Dane the color of dryer lint; I am afraid that the woman is unwell because she walks rigidly, her face pulsing as if intermittently electrified by pain. I sometimes imagine how, should I barrel around a corner to find her slumped on the ground, I would drape her over her dog, smack his withers, and watch as he, with his great dignity, carried her home."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"There is a boy of fifteen or so, tremendously fat, whose shirt is always off and who is always on the treadmill on his glassed-in porch. No matter how many times I find myself sailing past his window, there he is, his footsteps pounding so hard I can hear them from two blocks away. Because all the lights are on, to him there is nothing beyond the black in the window, and I wonder if he watches his reflection the way I watch him, if he sees how with each step his stomach ripples as if it were a pond into which someone had tossed a fist-size stone."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"Sometimes I think I see the stealthy couple who lived under our house, the particular angle of his solicitousness, his hand on her back, but when I come closer it is only a papaya tree bent over a rain barrel or two boys smoking in the bushes, who turn wary as I pass."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"And so I walk and I walk and at some point, near the wildly singing frogs, I look up and out of the darkness, a stun: the new possessor of the old nunnery has installed uplighting, not on the aesthetic blank of the cube but, rather, on the ardent live oak in front of it, so old and so broad it spreads out over a half acre. I’ve always known the tree was there, and my children have often swung on its low branches and from the bark plucked out ferns and epiphytes with which to adorn my head. But it has never before announced itself fully as the colossus it is, with its branches that are so heavy they grow toward the ground then touch and grow upward again; and thus, elbowing itself up, it brings to mind a woman at the kitchen table, knuckling her chin and dreaming. I stand shocked by its beauty, and, as I look, I imagine the swans on their island seeing the bright spark in the night and feeling their swan hearts moved. I heard that they have started building a nest again, though how they can bear it after all they’ve lost I do not know."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"It’s too much, it’s too much, I shout at my husband some nights when I come home, and he looks at me, afraid, this giant gentle man, and sits up in bed over his computer and says, softly, I don’t think you’ve walked it off yet, sweets, you may want to take one more loop. I go out again, furious, because the streets become more dangerous this late at night, and how dare he suggest risk like this to me, when I have proved myself vulnerable; but, then again, perhaps my warm house has become more dangerous as well. During the day, while my sons are in school, I can’t stop reading about the disaster of the world, the glaciers dying like living creatures, the great Pacific trash gyre, the hundreds of unrecorded deaths of species, millennia snuffed out as if they were not precious. I read and savagely mourn, as if reading could somehow sate this hunger for grief, instead of what it does, which is fuel it."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"On my nighttime walks the neighbors’ lives reveal themselves, the lit windows domestic aquariums. At times, I’m the silent witness to fights that look like slow-dancing without music. It is astonishing how people live, the messes they sustain, the delicious whiffs of cooking that carry to the street, the holiday decorations that slowly seep into daily décor. All January, I watched a Christmas bouquet of roses on one mantel diminish until the flowers were a blighted shrivel and the water green scum, a huge Santa on a stick still beaming merrily out of the ruins. Window after window nears, freezes with its blue fog of television light or its couple hunched over a supper of pizza, holds as I pass, then slides into the forgotten. I think of the way water gathers as it slips down an icicle’s length, pauses to build its glossy drop, becomes too fat to hang on, plummets down."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"I have somehow become a woman who yells, and, because I do not want to be a woman who yells, whose little children walk around with frozen, watchful faces, I have taken to lacing on my running shoes after dinner and going out into the twilit streets for a walk, leaving the undressing and sluicing and reading and singing and tucking in of the boys to my husband, a man who does not yell."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"On Valentine’s Day, I see red and white lights flashing from afar at the nunnery and walk faster in the hope that the nuns are having a love party, a disco rager, but instead I see an ambulance drive away, and the next day my fears are confirmed: the nuns have been further diminished, to two. Withholding erotic pleasure for the glory of God seems an anachronism in our age of pleasure, and, with their frailty and the hugeness of the house they rattle around in, it has been decided that the remaining nuns must decamp. I come to watch them the night they leave, expecting a moving truck, but there are only a few leather suitcases and a box or two in the back of the nuns’ station wagon. Their wrinkled faces droop with relief as they drive off."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"Now, while I stand before the collapsed house, the woman with the Great Dane slides by through the dark, and I notice how aggressively pale she has become, so skinny her cheeks must touch inside her mouth, her wig askew to show a rind of scalp above the bangs. If she, in turn, notices the particular dark spike of my unrest, she says only a soft good night and her dog looks at me with a kind of human compassion, and together they move off, stately and gentle, into the black."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"There’s the man who hisses nasties as he stands under the light outside a bodega with bars over its windows. I put on my don’t-fuck-with-me face, and he has yet to do more than hiss, but there is a part of me that is more than ready, that wants to use what’s building up."

Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"The cold lingers on into March. It has been a hard winter for everyone, though not as terrible as in the North, and I think of my friends and family up there with their dirty walls of snow and try to remember that the camellias and peach trees and dogwoods and oranges are all abloom here, even in the dark. I smell the jasmine potent in my hair the next morning, the way I used to smell cigarette smoke and sweat after going to a night club, back when I was young and could do such unthinkable things. There is a vernacular style of architecture, called Cracker, which is not meant to cause offense, all porches and high ceilings; and by the middle of March one of the oldest Cracker houses in north-central Florida is being renovated. The façade is preserved, but the rest is gutted. Night by night, I see what remains of the house as daily it is stripped away, until one night the house has entirely vanished: that morning it collapsed on a worker, who survived, like Buster Keaton, by standing in the window as the structure fell. I study the hole where a humble and unremarked history stood for so long, a house that watched the town press up, then grow around it, and I think of the construction worker who walked out of the collapse unhurt, what he was imagining. I think I know. One night just before Christmas I came home late after a walk and my husband was in the bathroom and I flipped open his computer and saw what I saw there, a conversation not meant for me, a snip of flesh that was not his, and without letting him know I was in the house I about-faced and went out again and walked until it was too cold to walk, until just before dawn, when the dew could easily have been ice."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"As I walk, I see strangers but also people I know. I look up in the beginning of February to see a close friend in a pink leotard in her window, stretching, but then, with a zip of understanding, I realize that she isn’t stretching, she is drying her legs, and the leotard is in fact her body, pinked from the hot shower. Even though I visited her in the hospital when both of her boys were born, held the newborns in my arms when they still smelled of her, saw the raw Cesarean split, it isn’t until I watch her drying herself that I understand that she is a sexual being, and then the next time we speak I can’t help but blush and endure images of her in extreme sexual positions. Mostly, however, I see the mothers I know in glimpses, bent like shepherdess crooks, scanning the floor for tiny Legos or half-chewed grapes or the people they once were slumped in the corners."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"I hope they understand, my sons, both now and in the future just materializing in the dark, that all these hours their mother has been walking so swiftly away from them I have not been gone, that my spirit, hours ago, slipped back into the house and crept into the room where their early-rising father had already fallen asleep, usually before 8 P.M., and that I touched this gentle man whom I love so desperately and somehow fear so much, touched him on the pulse in his temple and felt his dreams, which are too distant for the likes of me, and I climbed the creaking old stairs and at the top split in two and, heading right and left into separate rooms, slid through the crack under the doors and curled myself on the pillows to breathe into me the breath my boys breathed out. Every pause between the end of one breath and the beginning of the next is long; then again, nothing is not always in transition. Soon, tomorrow, the boys will be men, then the men will leave the house, and my husband and I will look at each other crouching under the weight of all that we wouldn’t or couldn’t yell, and all those hours outside walking, my body, my shadow, and the moon. It is terribly true, even if the truth does not comfort, that if you look at the moon for long enough night after night, as I have, you will see that the old cartoons are correct, that the moon is, in fact, laughing, but not at us, we who are too small and our lives too fleeting for it to give us any notice at all. ?"
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"There is one mostly windowless place in the neighborhood, a yellow brick monstrosity that I love nevertheless, because it houses nuns. There used to be six nuns there, but attrition happened, as it does with very old ladies, and now there are only three kindly sisters squeaking around that immense space in their sensible shoes. A Realtor friend told us that when it was built, in the nineteen-fifties, a bomb shelter was lowered into the porous limestone of the back yard, and during sleepless nights, when my body is in bed but my brain is still out walking in the dark, I like to imagine the nuns in full regalia in their shelter, singing hymns and spinning on a stationary bike to keep the light bulb sputtering on, while, aboveground, all has been blasted black and rusted hinges rasp the wind."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"And then there’s the therapist who every night sits at his desk in the study of his Victorian, which looks like a rotting galleon. He was caught in bed with the wife of one of his patients; the patient had a loaded shotgun out in the car. The wife died in coitus and the therapist survived with a bullet still in his hip, which makes him lurch when he gets up to pour himself more Scotch. There are rumors that he visits the cuckolded murderer in prison every week, though whether his motive is kindness or crowing remains in the shadows, as if motives could ever be pure. My husband and I had just moved in when the murder occurred; we were scraping rotting paint off the oak moldings in our dining room when the gunshots splattered the air, but of course we believed they were fireworks lit by the kids who lived a few houses down."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"Northern Florida is cold in January and I walk fast for warmth but also because, although the neighborhood is antique—huge Victorian houses radiating outward into nineteen-twenties bungalows, then mid-century modern ranches at the edges—it’s imperfectly safe. There was a rape a month ago, a jogger in her fifties pulled into the azaleas; and, a week ago, a pack of loose pit bulls ran down a mother with a baby in her stroller and mauled both, though not to death. It’s not the dogs’ fault, it’s the owners’ fault! dog-lovers shouted on the neighborhood e-mail list, and it’s true, it was the owners’ fault, but also those dogs were sociopaths. When the suburbs were built, in the seventies, the historic houses in the center of the town were abandoned to graduate students who heated beans over Bunsen burners on the heart-pine floors and sliced apartments out of ballrooms. When neglect and humidity caused the houses to rot and droop and develop rusty scales, there was a second abandonment, to poor people, squatters. We moved here ten years ago because our house was cheap and had virgin-lumber bones, and because I decided that if I had to live in the South, with its boiled peanuts and its Spanish moss dangling like armpit hair, at least I wouldn’t barricade myself with my whiteness in a gated community. Isn’t it . . . dicey? people our parents’ age would say, grimacing, when we told them where we lived, and it took all my will power not to say, Do you mean black, or just poor? Because it was both."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"Most changes are not so swift as the fallen house, and I notice how much weight the boy in his glassed-in sunporch has lost only when I realize from the sound of his footsteps that he’s no longer walking on his treadmill but running, and I look at him closely for the first time in a long time, my dear flabby friend whom I took for granted, and see a transformation so astonishing it’s as if a maiden had turned into a birch tree or a stream. During these few months this overweight child has turned into a slender man with pectoral rosebuds on his chest, sweating, smiling at himself in the glass, and I yelp aloud because of the swiftness of youth, these gorgeous changes that insist that not everything is decaying faster than we can love it."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"The week of heat proves temporary, a false start to the season. The weather again turns so clammy and cold that nobody else comes out and I shiver as I walk until I escape my chill by going into the drugstore for Epsom salts to soak my walking away. It is astonishing to enter the dazzling color, the ferocious heat after the chilly gray scale; to travel hundreds of miles over the cracked sidewalk and sparse palmetto and black path-crossing cats I dart away from, into this abundance with its aisles of gaudy trash and useless wrapping and plastic pull tabs that will one day end up in the throat of the earth’s last sea turtle. I find myself limping and the limp morphs into a kind of pained bopping because the music dredges up elementary school, when my parents were, astonishingly, younger than I am now, and that one long summer they listened on repeat to Paul Simon singing over springy African drums about a trip with a son, the human trampoline, the window in the heart; and it is both too much and too little and I leave without the salts because I am not ready for such easy absolution as this. I can’t."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"I walk on and as the boy’s trotting noises fade I keep hearing a disquieting constant sound that I can’t place. It is a sticky night: I shed my jacket last week, and it is only gradually that I understand that the noise is coming from the first air-conditioner turned on for the year. Soon they’ll all be on, crouched like trolls under the windows, their collective tuneless hum drowning out the night birds and frogs, and time will leap forward and the night will grow more and more reluctant to descend and, in the cool linger of twilight, people longing for real air after the sickly fake cold all day will come out and I will no longer have my dangerous dark streets to myself. There’s a pleasant smell like campfires in the air, and I think that the old turpentine-pine forests that ring the city must be on fire, which happens once a year or so, and I wonder about all those poor birds seared out of their sleep and into the disorienting darkness. I discover the next morning that it was worse, a controlled burn over the acres where dozens of the homeless had been living in a tent city, and I walk down to look, but it’s all great oaks, lonely and blackened from the waist down in a plain of steaming charcoal. When I return and see the six-foot fences around Bo Diddley Plaza which had gone up that same night for construction, or so the signs say, it is clear that it is part of a larger plan, balletically executed. I stand squinting in the daylight wanting to yell, looking to find a displaced person. Please, I think, please let my couple come by, let me see their faces at last, let me take their arms. I want to make them sandwiches and give them blankets and tell them that it’s O.K., that they can live under my house. I’m glad I can’t find anyone later, when I remember that it is not a kind thing to tell human beings that they can live under your house."
Ghosts and Empties	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/ghosts-and-empties			"The neighborhood goes dark as I walk, and a second neighborhood unrolls atop the daytime one. We have few street lights, and those I pass under make my shadow frolic; it lags behind me, gallops to my feet, gambols on ahead. The only other illumination is from the windows in the houses I pass and the moon that orders me to look up, look up! Feral cats dart underfoot, bird-of-paradise flowers poke out of the shadows, smells are exhaled into the air: oak dust, slime mold, camphor."

He was wearing a pair of too short trousers, perhaps the trousers from last year’s school uniform, and no shoes. The grounds on this side of the property were ragged but pretty, bounded by a low stone wall that allowed views across the fields to the gray slate roofs of Portlaoise. “I think it might’ve been a mistake to tell him about the ducks,” Bill said."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You refuse to panic, though. You repeat, silently, the spell taught to you by Aunt Farfalee (who is by now no bigger than a badger, with blank white eyes and fingers as thin and stiff as icicles). You concentrate—belief is crucial. One of the reasons that ordinary people are incapable of magic is a simple dearth of conviction."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The King gives the miller a glacial look, has a guard escort him away, and withdraws, locking the door behind him."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She stares at you. She doesn’t speak. Her life, since this morning, has become so strange to her (she who yesterday was sewing grain sacks and sweeping stray corn kernels from the floor) that the sudden appearance of a twisted and stub-footed man, just under four feet tall, with a chin as long as a turnip, seems merely another in the new string of impossibilities."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"As you wait, you notice the girl’s father, the miller (the former miller), seated among the members of court, in a tricorne hat and an ermine collar. He regards the line of assembled supplicants with a dowager aunt’s indignity and an expression of sentimental piety—the recently bankrupt man who gambled with his daughter’s life and, thanks to you, won."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			“My father would live in the castle. The King’s physicians would attend to him. He’s ill—grain dust gets into your lungs.”

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"This time, when you’ve finished, she gives you a ring. It, too, is cheap—silver, with a speck of diamond sunk into it."

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"It’s one thing to envy wealth and beauty and other gifts that seem to have been granted to others, but not to you, by obscure but undeniable givers.

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			The Queen keeps her face averted. The King emits a peal of laughter that sounds like defeat itself.

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She says, “Please reconsider.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			The miller must have felt driven to it. He must have thought he needed a claim that outrageous to attract the attention of the King.

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			You tell her you’re there to help. She nods her thanks. You get to work.

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"And, eventually . . . yes. The first few stalks are only touched with gold, like eroded relics, but the next are more gold than straw, and, soon enough, the wheel is spitting out strand upon strand of pure golden straw, not the hard yellow of some gold but a yellow suffused with pink, ever so slightly incandescent in the torch-lit room."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"There are two of you now. Neither is sufficient unto himself, but you learn, over time, to join your two halves together and hobble around. There are limits to what you can do, though you’re able to get from place to place. Each half, naturally, requires the coöperation of the other, and you find yourself getting snappish with yourself; you find yourself cursing yourself for your clumsiness, your overeagerness, your lack of consideration for your other half. You feel it doubly. Still, you go on. Still, you step in tandem, make your careful way up and down the stairs, admonishing, warning, each of you urging the other to slow down, or speed up, or wait a second. What else can you do? Each would be helpless without the other. Each would be stranded, laid flat, abandoned, bereft. ?"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			Imagine reaching the point at which you want a child more than you can remember ever wanting anything else.

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You waver. You’re assaulted by conflicting emotions. You understand the position she’s in. You care for her. You’re in love with her. It’s probably the hopeless ferocity of your love that impels you to stand firm, to refuse her refusal—she who has, on the one hand, succeeded spectacularly and, on the other, consented to what must be, at best, a chilly and brutal marriage. You can’t simply relent and walk back out of the room. You can’t bring yourself to be so debased."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You’re not about to reconsider. You might have considered reconsidering before you found yourself in the presence of these two, this tyrannical and ignorant monarch and the girl who agreed to marry him."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"A year later, when the little boy is born, you go to the palace."

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She says, “My father gave me these for my eighteenth birthday.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"And she looks like a queen. Her glowy pallor, her dark intelligent eyes, are every bit as royal-looking as they need to be."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			Welcome to the darker side of love.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You’ve thought of letting it pass—of course you have—but, after those months of sleepless musing over the life ahead, your return to the solitude and hopelessness in which you’ve lived for the past year (while people have tried to sell you key chains and medallions with the girl’s face on them, assuming, as well they might, that you’re just another customer, you, who wear the string of garnets under your shirt, the silver ring on your finger) . . . you can’t let it pass."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"When your turn arrives, you bow to Queen and King. The King nods his traditional, absent-minded acknowledgment. His head might have been carved from marble. His eyes are ice blue under the rim of his gem-encrusted crown. He might already be, in life, the stone likeness of himself that will top his sarcophagus."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You wish you could feel more purely angry about that possibility. You wish you didn’t sympathize, not even a little, with her in the predicament she’s created for herself."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You return to the castle the next day, and the next. The King scowls murderously (what story has he been told?) as the Queen runs through a gamut of guesses."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She slips it onto your pinkie. It fits, just barely. You stand for a moment staring at your hand, which is not by any standards a pretty sight, with its knobbed knuckles and thick, yellowed nails. But here it is, your hand, with her ring on one of its fingers."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She says, “Is it Brom?”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"With that, you’re gone."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The King looks disapprovingly at his wife. His face bears no hint of a question. He skips over the possibility of innocence. He wonders only what, exactly, it is that she has done."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"“That’s not magic,” she says, laughing."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			No.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She interprets your silence as a yes. Yes, you’ll turn her in if she doesn’t promise the child to you."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"“But you’d be married to him, the man who was going to kill you if you didn’t produce the goods.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You tell her, in the general spirit of her husband’s fixation on threes, that she has three days to guess your name. If she can accomplish that, if she can guess your name within the next three days, the deal’s off."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"“Thank you,” she says."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She says, “All right, then. I promise to give you my firstborn child.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"Until those nights of spinning, no girl ever let you get close enough for you to realize that you’re possessed of wit and allure and compassion, that you’d be coveted, you’d be sought after, if you were just . . ."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You stamp your right foot. You stamp it so hard, with such enchantment-compelled force, that it goes right through the marble floor, sinks to your ankle."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She looks entirely natural on the throne, every bit as much as she does on banners and mugs and key chains. She has noticed you, but nothing has changed in her expression. She listens, with the customary feigned attention, to the woman whose goats are sitting down to dinner with the family, to the man who doesn’t want his fortune sucked away before he dies. It’s widely known that these audiences with the King and Queen never produce results of any kind. Still, people want to come and be heard."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You do not, of course, say this aloud, but if she can’t you’ll raise the child in a forest glade. You’ll teach him the botanical names of the trees, and the secret names of the animals. You’ll instruct him in the arts of mercy and patience. And you’ll see, in the boy, certain of her aspects—the great dark pools of her eyes, maybe, or her slightly exaggerated, aristocratic nose."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The unextraordinary house to which you return nightly? It’d be someone’s future ur-house. It’d be the place that someone would remember, decades hence, as a seat of comfort and succor, its rooms rendered larger and grander, exalted, by memory. This sofa, those lamps, purchased in a hurry, deemed good enough for now (they seem to be here still, years later)—they’d be legendary to someone."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"With that thought, you decide to offer a compromise."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She drapes the necklace over your head. An awkward moment occurs when the beads catch on your chin, but the girl lifts them off, and her fingertips brush against your face. The strand of beads falls onto your chest. Onto the declivity where, were you a normal man, your chest would be."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You are not the first in line. You wait as a corpulent young woman reports that a coven of witches in her district is causing the goats to walk on their hind legs and saunter into her house as if they owned the place. You wait as an old man objects to the new tax being levied on every denizen who lives past the age of eighty, which is the King’s way of claiming for himself what would otherwise be passed along to his subjects’ heirs."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"When it’s all finished, she says, “My lord.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			“Let me give you something.”
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She stares at you, dumbfounded, by way of an answer."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"Right. One last roomful of straw, twice the size again. The King insists on this third and final act of alchemy. He believes, it seems, that value resides in threes, which would explain the three garish and unnecessary towers he’s had plunked onto the castle walls, the three advisers to whom he never listens, the three annual parades in celebration of nothing in particular beyond the King himself."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You suspect, though, that she still feels endangered, that she can’t be sure her husband will forgive her for allowing him to believe that she herself spun the straw into gold. Having produced a male heir, she has now, after all, rendered herself dispensable. And so, when confronted, she probably came up with . . . some tale of spells and curses, some fabrication in which you, a hobgoblin, are entirely to blame."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			She laughs and claps her hands.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			You slip away without speaking. You’re afraid that anything you say would be embarrassingly earnest.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The King shoots her an arctic glare. She looks at you, her dark eyes avid and level, her neck arched and her shoulders flung back."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"So when you materialize in the chamber full of straw it has nothing to do with magic. The girl, though, is surprised and impressed. Already you’ve got credibility."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			If she can’t . . .
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"And at first glance you see why the miller thought his gamble might work. She’s a true beauty, slightly unorthodox, in the way of most great beauties. Her skin is as smooth and poreless as pale-pink china, her nose ever so slightly longer than it should be, her brown-black eyes wide-set, sable-lashed, all but quivering with curiosity, with depths."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The King’s response? Do it again tonight, in a bigger room, with twice as much straw."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You do it again that night. The spinning is effortless by now. As you spin, you perform little comic flourishes for the girl. You spin for a while one-handed. You spin with your back to the wheel. You spin with your eyes closed."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"When you’ve finished, she says, “I’m afraid I have nothing more to give you.”"

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She says, “I’d be queen.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She glances over at the King, and can’t conceal a moment of miller’s-daughter nervousness."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You bow and depart. She sees you slipping away through the secret door, devoid of hinges or knob, one of many commissioned by the long-dead paranoid king."

Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"Then there is a moment—a millimoment, the tiniest imaginable fraction of time—when the Queen thinks of giving her baby to you. You see it in her face. There’s a moment when she knows that she could rescue you as you once rescued her, when she imagines throwing it all away and going off with you and her child. She does not, could not, love you, but she remembers standing in the room on that first night, when the straw started turning to gold, when she understood that an impossible situation had been met with an impossible result, when she unthinkingly laid her hand on the sackcloth-covered gnarls of your shoulder, and she thinks (whoosh, by the time you’ve read whoosh, she’s no longer thinking it) that she could leave her heartless husband, she could live in the woods with you and the child. . . ."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"Neither Aunt Farfalee nor the oldest and most revered of the texts has anything to say about transforming gnomes into straight-spined, striking men. Aunt Farfalee told you, in the low, rattling sigh that was once her voice, that magic has its limits, that the flesh has, over centuries, proved consistently vulnerable to afflictions but never, not even for the most potent of wizards, subject to improvement."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"It’s the strangest sensation imaginable. It’s as if some strip of invisible tape that’s been holding you together, from mid-forehead to crotch, had suddenly been stripped away. It’s no more painful than pulling off a bandage. And then you fall onto your knees, and you’re looking at yourself, twice, both of you pitched forward, blinking in astonishment at a self who is blinking in astonishment at you, who are blinking in astonishment at him, who is blinking in astonishment at you. . . ."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"But you find—surprise—that you like this capitulation from her, this helpless compliance, from the most recent embodiment of all the girls over all the years who’ve given you nothing, not even a curious glance."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			She speaks your name.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You pause. You’re shocked to realize that you want something more from her. You’ve told yourself, the past two nights, that the necklace and the ring are marvels, but extraneous acts of gratitude, that you’d have done what you did for nothing more than the sight of her thankful face."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"If you had a child, your life would be about more than getting through the various holiday rushes, and wondering exactly how insane Mrs. Witters in Accounts Payable is going to be on any given day. It’d be about procuring tiny shoes and pull toys and dental checkups; it’d be about paying into a college fund."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The miller is apparently unable to imagine all the pale-necked, shyly smiling girls the King has met already. Like most fathers, he finds it inconceivable that his daughter may not be singular; that she may be lovely and funny and smart but not so exceptionally so as to obliterate all the other contending girls."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"It’s not hard to get an audience with the King and Queen. One of the traditions, a custom so old and entrenched that even this King doesn’t dare abolish it, is the weekly Wednesday audience, at which any citizen who wishes to can appear in the throne room and register a complaint."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You say, “My Queen, I think you know what I’ve come for.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You bow again and, as straight-backed as your torqued spine will allow, you stride out of the throne room."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			The next day . . .
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			You go to the palace.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			And . . .
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You hear about it the next day, as you walk along the outskirts of town, wearing the strand of garnets under your stained woollen shirt."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			“Is it Ulric?”
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			“No need.”
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You don’t want to descend to blackmail. You wish she hadn’t posed the question, and you have no idea how to answer. You’d never expose her. But you’re so sure of your ability to rescue the still unconceived child, who, without your help, will be abused by his father (don’t men who’ve been abused always do the same to their children?) and become another punishing and capricious king, who’ll demand meaningless parades and still gaudier towers and God knows what else."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You’ll never know what went on between Queen and King once they were alone together. You hope that she confessed everything and insisted that a vow, once made, cannot be broken. You even go so far as to imagine that she defended you for your offer of a possible reprieve."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The Queen appears to be flustered. She says, “Well, then, this is my last chance.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You both—you and the girl—watch, enraptured, as the piles of straw dwindle and the golden strands skitter onto the limestone floor. It’s the closest you’ve come yet to love, to lovemaking—you at the spinning wheel and the girl behind you (she forgetfully puts her gentle hand on your shoulder), watching in shared astonishment as the straw is spun into gold."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			You’re not sure whether she’s referring to you or to God.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You wish you found it more unpleasant. Or, at any rate, you wish you found it as unpleasant as it actually is."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The miller, poor, foolish, doting father that he is, never expected his daughter to be locked into a room full of straw and commanded to spin it all into gold by morning, any more than most fathers expect their daughters to be unsought after by boys, or rejected by colleges, or abused by the men they eventually marry. Such notions rarely appear on the spectrum of paternal possibility."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"“Let me raise your first child,” you say. “I’ll be a good father. I’ll teach the child magic. I’ll teach the child generosity and forgiveness. The King isn’t going to do much along those lines, don’t you think?”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You leave, again without speaking. This time, though, it’s not for fear of embarrassment. This time it’s because you’re greedy and ashamed; it’s because you want the child, you need the child, and yet you can’t bear to be yourself at this moment; you can’t stand there any longer enjoying your mastery over her."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			It’s looking good.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She doesn’t care for you, after all. You’re someone who did her a favor once. She doesn’t even know your name."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			It’s not possible.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			It gets worse.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The royal wedding takes place. Suddenly this common girl, this miller’s daughter, is a celebrity; her face emblazons everything from banners to souvenir coffee mugs."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The world, which was about to transform itself, changes back again. The world reveals itself to be nothing more than you, about to scuttle out of the throne room, hurry through town, and return to the empty little house that’s always there, that’s always been there, waiting for you."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"“No,” you answer. “But magic is sometimes all about knowing where the secret door is and how to open it.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			Whoosh.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"How likely is it that he’ll see your fire, creep through the bracken, and listen to the ditty you’re singing?"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"It doesn’t go well, at first. The straw, run through the spinning wheel, comes out simply as straw, shredded and bent."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"He’s not joking. This, after all, is the King who passed the law about putting trousers on cats and dogs, who made laughing too loudly a punishable crime. According to rumor, he was abused by his father, the last King. But that’s the story people always tell, isn’t it, when they want to explain inexplicable behavior?"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			She lifts her head and looks at you.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no and no.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			Oh.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The Queen nods. You can’t tell what’s going through her mind. Apparently, she has learned, during the past year, how to evince an expression of royal opacity, something she did not possess when you were spinning the straw into gold for her."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"Castles are easy to penetrate. Most people don’t know that; most people think of them as fortified, impregnable. Castles, however, have been remodelled and revised, over and over, by countless generations. There was the child-king who insisted on secret passageways, with peepholes that opened through the eyes of the ancestral portraits. There was the paranoid king who had escape tunnels dug, miles of them, opening out into woods, country lanes, and graveyards."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"Spinning straw into gold is beyond your current capabilities, but not necessarily impossible to learn. There are ancient texts. There’s your Aunt Farfalee, who is older than some of the texts but still alive, as far as you know, and the only truly gifted member of your ragtag cohort, who are generally more prone to make rats speak in Flemish, or to summon beetles out of other people’s Christmas pies."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"And, with that, you split in half."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			The girl pulled it off. She spun the straw into gold.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"“If I refuse,” she says, “will you expose me?”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			You have the courtesy to refrain from answering.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"This, then, is love. This is the experience from which you’ve felt exiled for so long. This rage mixed with empathy, this simultaneous desire for admiration and victory."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You stamp your left foot. Same thing. You are standing now, trembling, insane with fury and disappointment, ankle-deep in the royal floor."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			What if you had a child?
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			You tell her that a promise was made. You leave it at that.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You are driven slightly insane—you try to talk yourself down; it works some nights better than others—by the fact that, for so much of the population, children simply . . . appear. Bing bang boom. A single act of love and, nine months later, this flowering, as mindless and senseless as a crocus bursting out of a bulb."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She turns to you again. She says, “This is awkward, isn’t it?”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"When you hear the story about the girl who can supposedly spin straw into gold (it’s the talk of the kingdom), you don’t immediately think, This might be a way for me to get a child. That would be too many steps down the line for most people, and you, though you have a potent heart and ferocity of intention, are not a particularly serious thinker. You work more from instinct. It’s instinct, then, that tells you, Help this girl and good may come of it. Maybe simply because you, and you alone, have something to offer her. You who’ve never before had much to offer any of the girls who passed by, leaving traces of perfume in their wake, a quickening of the air they so recently occupied."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The Queen silently summons two of the guards, who pull you in two pieces from the floor in which you’ve become mired, who carry you, one half apiece, out of the room. They take you all the way back to your place in the woods and leave you there."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The King, who really hates being duped, announces, from the doorway of the cellar room filled with straw, that if the girl hasn’t spun it all into gold by morning he’ll have her executed."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"Having a child is not, however, anything like ordering a pizza. Even less so if you’re a malformed, dwarfish man whose occupation, were you forced to name one, would be . . . What would you call yourself? A goblin? An imp? Adoption agencies are reluctant about doctors and lawyers if they’re single and over forty. So go ahead. Apply to adopt an infant as a two-hundred-year-old gnome."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You’re descended from a long line of minor wizards. Your people have, for generations, been able to summon rain, exorcise poltergeists, find lost wedding rings."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			Surely the girl will refuse.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"It’s too much, just sitting inside like that, by yourself. It’s too little. You hurry out into the blackness of the forest night, amid the chirruping of the insects and the far-off hoots of the owls. You build a fire. You grant yourself a pint of ale, and then you grant yourself another. And, almost against your will, it seems that you’re dancing around the fire. It seems that you’ve made up a song:"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You go to the castle one more time and do it again. It should be routine by now, the sight of the golden straw piling up, the fiery gleam of it, but somehow repetition hasn’t rendered it commonplace. It is (or so you imagine) a little like being in love, like wondering anew, every morning, at the outwardly unremarkable fact that your lover is there, in bed beside you, about to open her eyes, and that your face will be the first thing she sees."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The miller starts to confess, to beg forgiveness. He was joking; no, he was sinfully proud. He wanted his daughter to meet the King. He was worried about her future. I mean, Your Majesty, you can’t be thinking of killing her. . . ."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"She looks down at the floor, which is littered with stray strands of gold."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"How likely is it that the youngest of the Queen’s messengers, the one most desperate for advancement, the one who’s been threatened with dismissal (he’s too fervent and dramatic in his delivery of messages, he bows too low, he’s getting on the King’s nerves) . . . how likely is it that that particular young hustler, knowing every inch of the civilized kingdom to have been scoured already, every door knocked on, will think to go out into the woods that night, wondering if he’s wasting precious time but hoping that maybe, just maybe, the little man lives off the grid?"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The Queen nods in agreement. The King scowls. He can’t, however, ask questions, not here, not with his subjects lined up before him. He can’t appear to be baffled, underinformed, misused."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"As you stand in line, you see that the Queen has noticed you."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"The Queen sends messengers out all over the kingdom, in an attempt to track down your name. You know how futile that is. You live in a cottage carved into a tree, so deep in the woods that no hiker or wanderer has ever passed by. You have no friends, and your relatives live not only far away but in residences at least as obscure as your own (consider Aunt Farfalee’s tiny grotto, reachable only by swimming fifty feet under water). You’re not registered anywhere. You’ve never signed anything."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You suppose (as an aspiring parent yourself, you prefer to think of other parents as un-deranged) he is hoping that if he can get his daughter into the palace, if he can figure out a way for her to meet the King, for the King to see the pale grace of the girl’s neck and her shy smile, and hear the sweet clarinet tone of her soft but surprisingly sonorous voice, the King will be so smitten (doesn’t every father believe his daughter to be irresistible?) that he’ll forget about the absurd straw-into-gold story."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			“My father could live in the palace with me.”
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"He’s joking, right?"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"No one in the family, not in the past few centuries, at any rate, has thought of making a living at it. It’s not . . . respectable. It smells of desperation. And—as is the way with spells and conjurings—it’s not a hundred per cent reliable. It’s an art, not a science. Who wants to refund a farmer’s money as he stands destitute in his still parched fields? Who wants to say, “I’m sorry, it works most of the time,” to the elderly couple who still hear cackles of laughter coming from under their mattress, whose cutlery still jumps up from the dinner table and flies around the room?"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You listen carefully, then, when you hear the rumor. Some impoverished miller—a man whose business is going under (the small-mill owners, the ones who grind by hand, are vanishing; their flour and meal cost twice as much as the big-brand products, which are free of the gritty bits that can find their way into a sack of flour no matter how careful you are), a man who has no health insurance or investments or pension plan (he’s needed every cent just to keep the mill open)—that man has told the King that his daughter can spin straw into gold."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You return, triumphant, to the castle on the third and final afternoon. You are for the first time in your life a figure of power, of threat. Finally, you cannot be ignored or dismissed."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"It’s surprising, then, that on this final night you don’t want to leave unrewarded. That you desire, with upsetting urgency, another token, a talisman, a further piece of evidence. Maybe it’s because you know you won’t see her again."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"But still she takes a strand of beads from her neck and holds them out to you. They’re garnets, cheap, probably dyed, though in this room, at this moment, with all that golden straw emanating its faint light, they’re as potently red-black as heart’s blood."
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You’re as surprised as she is when you hear yourself say, “Promise me your firstborn child, then.”"
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			That’s the reward? Marriage to a man who’d have had you decapitated if you failed to produce not just one but three miracles?
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			No.
Little Man	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/little-man			"You’ll ask yourself, afterward, Why did I build a fire in front of the cottage tree and do that little song and dance? It seems harmless at the time, and you are so happy, so sure. You find yourself sitting alone in your parlor, thinking of where the cradle should go, wondering who’ll teach you how to fold a diaper, picturing the child’s face as he looks up at you and says, “Father.”"

My Curls Have Blown All the Way to China	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/21/my-curls-have-blown-all-the-way-to-china			I took a piece of paper from Moshe’s messy desk and made a list of winter clothes to buy:
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Sally had always known that the white brocade had belonged to a lady who died before her wedding. The man she was meant to marry had owned a stately home with a deer park, and the twist in the story was that she’d been a nurse, had saved his life when he was ill. Ann and Kit Seaton—who was Sally’s godmother—had picnicked with them once in the deer park. Then the nurse had caught diphtheria from one of her patients and was dead within a week. Her fiancé had written to them, returning their designs and saying that he would not need their services after all, “for the saddest of reasons.” They hadn’t known what to do with the fabric, Ann said. They couldn’t just post it to him. They hadn’t even sent a note—they couldn’t think what words to use; they were too young. Ann hadn’t kept his letter or her designs; she regretted now that she’d hardly kept anything when she got married and she and Kit gave up the business. There were only a few woven Gallagher and Seaton labels, tangled in a snarled mass of thread and bias binding and rickrack braid in her workbasket. She and Kit had never even thought to take photographs of the clothes they’d made."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Ann put on the percolator in the kitchenette. Kit had grown up in France, or claimed she had, and insisted that they always make real coffee. They served it in little turquoise coffee cups, with bitter-almond biscuits, on a Japanese lacquer tray that Ann had found in a junk shop. Sometimes the coffee was so strong the clients could hardly swallow it."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“Come on, Annie-Pannie. You think it’s pretty extraordinary, too, I know you do. Don’t be chippy, don’t get on your old socialist high horse, just because you’ve got a pash on Mr. Misery-Guts Donny Ross.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			“What do you know about Fishponds?” Ann said sharply.
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“Oh, that won’t be a problem,” Nola began to say. “Because the man I’m marrying, my fiancé . . .”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"She showed Nola into the fitting room. They had a sewing room and a fitting room and a little windowless kitchenette and a lavatory; a dentist on the ground floor used the front basement rooms for storage, and they sometimes heard his heavy footsteps on the stairs. The Third Programme helped drown out the sound of his drill when clients came for fittings. Ann and Kit had made gold velvet curtains for the fitting-room windows and covered a chaise longue in matching velvet; on the white walls there were prints of paintings by Klee and Utrillo and a gilt antique mirror with a plant trailing round it. Morning light waited, importantly empty, in the cheval glass. Kit sometimes brought her boyfriends to this room at night, and Ann had to be on the lookout for the telltale signs—dirty ashtrays, wineglasses, crumpled cushions. She was convinced that Kit had actually been making love once on top of someone’s evening dress, laid out on the chaise longue after a fitting."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"The surprise was that Blaise turned out to be as much of a socialist as Donny Ross, even if he did own a deer park. He didn’t object to any of the taxes, he said. The only damn problem was finding enough money to pay them, because old houses these days didn’t come with money attached. Thwaite was a bottomless pit when it came to money. He ought to give the place up, sell it as a hotel or something, but he was too sentimental. Anyway, there were an awful lot of big old houses on the market, and it wasn’t a good time in the hotel business. He and Nola called each other “Dear” and passed each other salt, in a twist of greaseproof paper, to go with the eggs. Kit had made little crustless sandwiches with cucumber and foie gras from a tin, and pinched bottles of champagne from her father’s wine cellar. She still lived at home in the suburbs with her widowed daddy, retired from his insurance job, whom she adored—though Ann thought he was a horrible old man. He’d told her once that little tarts ought to be flogged, to teach them a lesson."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Ann Gallagher was listening to the wireless, cutting out a boxy short jacket with three-quarter-length sleeves, in a pale-lilac wool flecked with navy. She had cut the pattern from her own design—there was a matching knee-length pencil skirt—then pinned the paper shapes onto the length of cloth, arranging and rearranging them like pieces of a puzzle to make them fit with minimum waste. Now her scissors bit in with finality, growling against the wood surface of the table, the cloth falling cleanly away from the blades. These scissors were sacrosanct and deadly, never to be used on anything that might blunt them. Ann and her friend Kit Seaton were renting the back basement of a big house in a residential area of Bristol for their dressmaking business; because the house was built on a hill, their rooms opened onto a garden, and sunlight fell through the French windows in shifting patches onto Ann’s cutting table."

Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"When Sally Ross was sixteen, in 1972, her mother, Ann, made her a jacket out of an old length of silk brocade, embroidered with flowers. The white brocade had been around since Sally could remember, folded in a cupboard along with all the other pieces of fabric that might be used sometime, for something or other. Now they decided to dye it purple. This was the same summer that Sally’s father, the doctor, had moved out to live with another woman. Ann had sold all his jazz records and chopped his ties into bits with her dressmaking scissors, then burned them in the garden. Of course, Sally and her sisters and brother were on their mother’s side. Still, they were shocked by something so vengeful and flaunting, which they’d never before imagined as part of her character. Her gestures seemed drawn from a different life than the one they’d had so far, in which things had been mostly funny and full of irony."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Kit flopped back onto the chaise longue in exaggerated despair, limbs flung out like a doll’s. “When she comes back, you’re to tell her you’ve changed your mind. I’d die for an invitation to go out there and poke around. Imagine what they’ve got in their attic!”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“She knows what she’s doing,” Kit reassured Nola. “She’s a genius.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“These do look beautiful,” Nola conceded yearningly."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Later that afternoon, while Kit put on different outfits to entertain Ray—and at some point Ray exhibited himself, too, in a green satin gown, made up with Kit’s lipstick and powder—Donny Ross came prowling around where Ann was cutting out the lining for the suit. “Do you mind?” he said. And he called her an angel-innocent and a clever daft thing, in a comical, mincing, falsetto voice. Ann didn’t usually let people into the sewing room; she was anxious about keeping the fabrics pristine. With his hands in his pockets, frowning, Donny was working through some jazz tune to himself, in a way that you couldn’t really call singing; it was more as if he were imitating all the different instruments in turn, taking his hands out of his pockets to bang out the drum part on the end of her cutting table. Ann might just as well not have been there: he threw his head back and stared up into the corners of the room as if all the evidence of her sewing, spread out around him, were simply too frivolous for him to look at. It was peculiar that she didn’t feel any urge to entertain or charm him, though she knew how charming she could be when she tried. She carried on steadily, concentrating on her work, feeling as if some new excitement were waiting folded up inside her, not even tried on yet."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"She gave Kit the piece of paper where Nola had written down the details, and expected her to make her usual disdainful face when she read through it, as if something smelled funny. Kit had a long, horsey face, tousled honey-colored hair, and a stubby, sexy, decisive little body, like an overdeveloped child’s; she expressed all her tastes and distastes as if they afflicted her physically, through her senses. To Ann’s surprise, she sat up excitedly. “Oh, Lawd, this is a marvel. I can’t believe you don’t know where this wedding is, you angel-innocent. It’s the most perfect little bijou Queen Anne house, tucked away in its own deer park on the way to Bath. Look what you’ve done, you clever daft thing! The pictures will be in all the good papers.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"She didn’t have the same broad Bristol accent as her parents—Ann’s mother would have said that she was nicely spoken. It was about a wedding dress, of course. The wedding would be in June, Nola said. It would be a quiet one, at least she hoped so. She knew that this was short notice and probably Ann was all booked up, but they had decided in a hurry. “Not that kind of hurry,” she added, laughing without embarrassment. “I suppose you sometimes have to let out the waists as the brides get bigger.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"After the conference lunch, in a lull while the teachers drank coffee outside in the sunshine, Sally wandered upstairs to look around. Although the rooms of the house had been converted into teaching spaces, with bookshelves and blackboards and overhead projectors, you could see that it had been a home once. One of the rooms was papered with Chinese wallpaper, pale blue, patterned with birds and bamboo leaves. In another room, polished wood cupboards were built in from floor to ceiling; these were full of stationery supplies and art materials. Someone from the catering staff had followed Sally upstairs, and she found herself explaining the whole story to him—about her parents separating and the jacket and her mother’s sad association with the house. This wasn’t her boyfriend but another boy who worked with them, better-looking and more dangerous. Sally was trying her power out on him; she shed tears of self-pity, until he put his arms around her and kissed her. And, amid all the complications and adjustments that ensued, she forgot to collect her jacket when they left, though she didn’t confess this to her mother until months later. A jacket hardly mattered, in the scheme of things. ?"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Kit came slamming through the glass door after lunch, in the middle of telling some crazy story, screaming with laughter, half cut already, with a couple of men friends in tow. Ann was just starting on the lining for the lilac suit. One of the friends was a medic, Ray, Kit’s current boyfriend, or he thought he was—Ann knew about other things, one married man in particular. The second friend was also a medic. Ann hadn’t seen him before: Donny Ross, who played the piano, apparently, in a jazz band. Donny Ross had a body as thin as a whip and cavernous cheeks and thick jet-black hair with a long quiff that flopped into his eyes. His mouth was small and his grin was surprisingly girlish, showing his small teeth, though he didn’t grin much—or say much. He was mostly saturnine and judgmental. It was obvious to Ann right away that Donny didn’t like Kit. He saw through her bossy know-how and the whole parade of her snobbery: going on about how Proust was her favorite author and her mother used to have her hats made on the Champs-Élysées and weren’t the little bureaucrats who wanted our taxes so ghastly—as if she couldn’t guess what Ann had guessed already, that Donny was a socialist."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“What happened to your leg, old man?” Ray asked."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“Which, in a funny way, you could say he was,” Donny Ross said."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Ann wondered whether Nola Higgins was impressed by the glamorous new style of her life or simply accepted it, as calmly as she’d have accepted any place she walked into. She must have seen some things during the course of her work as a nurse, some of them horrors. Nola’s home perm made her look closer to their mothers’ age; the dark curls were too tight and flat against her head, and when she sat down she tugged her skirt over her knees, as if she were self-conscious about her broad hips. But her brown eyes were very alert and steady, and she had the kind of skin that was so soft it looked almost loose on her bones, matte pink, as if she were wearing powder, though she wasn’t."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Blaise Perney—who opened the side door himself, promptly, as if he’d been waiting for them—wasn’t in the least what they’d prepared for. To begin with, he looked younger than Nola: very tall and ugly, diffident and smiling and stooped, with a long bony face and hair like crinkled pale silk. He welcomed them effusively, blushing as if they were doing him a favor, and said that he was so looking forward to getting to know them. Ann thought with relief that Blaise could easily be won over; she always made this assessment, when she first met men, of whether or not she could get around them if she chose to test her power. Charlie, for instance—although he liked her and flirted with her madly—she could never have deflected from his own path in a million years, whereas Ray was a walkover. Blaise said that Nola was packing a picnic in the kitchen. He led them through a succession of shadowy, chilly, gracious rooms with shuttered windows, apologizing for the mess and the state of decay: his dragging foot seemed to be part of his diffidence."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Ann really was convinced that if you could only find the right clothes you could become whatever you wanted, you could transform yourself. She let the heavy fabric fall out of its folds and made Nola stand up, then held it against her in front of the cheval mirror, pulling it in around her waist, frowning expertly at Nola’s reflection across her shoulder, tugging and smoothing the cloth as if she were molding something. “You see? The off-white is very flattering against your dark hair and your lovely skin. There isn’t enough for a whole dress if you want full length, but I think we could get a fitted bodice and a little peplum out of it and find a matching plain fabric for the skirt. With your full figure you want to go for a nice clean silhouette, nothing fussy. This could look stunning, actually.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"She told Kit about Nola’s wedding then; best to get it over with while she was in this mood, and there was company. “I know it’s not exactly our style,” she said. “But we could do with the work.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Sally and her mother were absorbed together that summer in projects of transformation, changing their clothes or their rooms or themselves. Sally stood over the soup of murky cold-dye in the old washing-up bowl, watching for the blisters of fabric to erupt above the surface, prodding them down with the stained handle of a wooden spoon, feeling hopeful in spite of everything. She wasn’t beautiful like her mother, but Ann made her feel that there was a way around that. Ann always had a plan—and Sally yielded to the gifted, forceful hands that came plucking at her eyebrows or twisting up her hair, whipping the tape measure around her waistline. The jacket was a success: Sally wore it a lot, unbuttoned over T-shirts and jeans. They both dieted, and her mother lost a stone; she’d never looked so lovely. Ann got a babysitter and went out to parties with spare knickers and a toothbrush in her handbag, but came home alone. At the end of the summer, their father moved back in again."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"These were private rooms, not open to the public, not arranged to look like scenes from the past but with the past and the present simply jumbled together: a cheap little wireless set balanced on a pile of leather-bound books, a milkman’s calendar among the silver-framed photos on a desk whose rolltop was broken, an ordinary electric fire in a huge marble fireplace dirty with wood ash. Ann found this much more romantic; it set her imagination racing. What she could have done with this place if it were hers! In the cavernous, dark kitchen, where the giant-sized iron range was cold and there were fifty dinner plates in a wooden rack, Nola was boiling eggs on a Baby Belling, looking surprisingly at home. Ann’s envy was only fleeting—it was benevolent, gracious. Whatever lay ahead for her, she thought, was better than any house."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"And then she had to break off, because her eyes brimmed with tears and a red heat came into her cheeks; Ann had an intuition that the flush ran thrillingly all over her body. Who’d have thought that Nola Higgins would be susceptible to that kind of thrill? She was bending over her handbag, fishing for a handkerchief. “How silly,” she said. “It’s ridiculous, Ann. But I’m just so happy. I can’t quite believe that I’m saying those words, that we’re really going to be married. He’s such a lovely chap. And he’ll be able to pay your prices. I knew you wouldn’t be cheap.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"They had not, after all, gone back inside Thwaite House to look in the cedarwood presses. No one had had any appetite, in the intensity of their present, for the past. When they had parted finally, because the medics were on night duty and had to get back, they all made passionate promises to return. The next time they came, Blaise said, he would show them everything. They couldn’t wait, they told him. Soon. That was in 1953."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“Do you think so?” Nola’s eyes, doubting and trusting, looked out from the reflection into hers."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Eventually, they decided on something classic, full-length, very simple, skimming Nola’s figure without hugging it. Ann would use the brocade that Nola had brought for the bodice and the sleeves, and a matching silk satin, if they could find it, for the skirt. “Unless there’s any more of the brocade?”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Someone came down the steps to the side entrance, then tapped on the opaque glass panes of the door; Ann looked up, irritated at being interrupted. Kit said that they should always switch over to the Third Programme when clients came—it was more sophisticated—but there wasn’t time, and Ann could make out enough through the bubbled glass to know that the woman standing on the other side wasn’t sophisticated anyway. She was too bulky, planted there too stolidly, with an unassuming patience. Some clients pushed their faces up against the door and rattled the handle if they were kept waiting for even a moment."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Then Ann began to understand why Nola thought she was so lucky. She explained it all to Kit, and showed her the old brocade that Nola had left. “She said he had lots more fabric in his house. And old clothes, too—she thought I might like to see them. And I turned her down! I thought he must be running some kind of secondhand shop!”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“I don’t care who she is. She’s marrying a Perney, and they’ve owned Thwaite Park for centuries.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Nola Higgins stood with military straightness, shoulders squared; she was buttoned up into some sort of navy-blue uniform, unflatteringly tight over her heavy bust. “I know I shouldn’t have turned up without an appointment,” she apologized cheerfully. “But do you mind if I ask a quick question?”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			“But Nola Higgins is from Fishponds. We were at school together.”
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“I’m happy for you,” Ann said."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"On the day of the picnic it was warm for the first time since winter and the clear air was as heady as spirits. Ray put down the roof on his convertible and drove fast. Kit tied on a head scarf, but Ann hadn’t thought to bring one, so her hair whipped in her face, and by the time they turned in between the crumbling stone gateposts—there were no gates; they must have been requisitioned for the war effort—she was bewildered with the speed and the rushing air. The house was a Palladian box, perfectly proportioned, understated to the point of plainness, its blond stone blackened with soot; sooty sheep grazed on a long meadow sloping down in front of it. A few skinny lambs scampered under the ancient oaks, where new leaves were just beginning to spring out, implausibly, from the gray crusty limbs. There were other cars in the drive and in the car park, because the house and the grounds were open to the public. Laughing and talking confidently—at least, Kit was laughing and confident—they walked right past the main entrance, where tickets were on sale; peacocks were squawking and displaying on the stable wall. Nola had instructed them to come around the side of the house, then press the bell beside a door marked “Private,” in white painted letters. Ann half expected a butler. Donny was stiff with disapproval of class privilege."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Of course they’d planned all along to ask her this, angling for an invitation to Thwaite Park. And, eagerly, Nola invited them. “Blaise would love to meet you,” she said. Privately, Kit chose to doubt this. “He probably thinks it’s pretty funny,” she said, “being invited to meet his fiancée’s dressmaker. I mean, their love affair’s the most darling romantic story I’ve ever heard, and Nola’s an angel—but what I wouldn’t give to be a fly on the wall at that wedding! Fishponds meets Thwaite Park.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“I won’t keep you long,” Nola said. “But I have a favor to ask.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Blaise apologized, because he wasn’t a war hero. He’d managed to catch the dreaded polio—wasn’t that childish of him? Nola spread out a tablecloth, in a little hollow among the bluebells, while the young doctors interrogated her sternly about neck stiffness, light intolerance, respiratory muscle weakness. Blaise rolled up his trouser leg and Ray and Donny examined his twisted, skinny calf; Kit turned her face away, because she didn’t like looking at sickness or deformed things. Yet Blaise Perney was hardly deformed at all; he’d made a wonderful recovery. He told them that Nola had saved his life, and she laughed with shy pleasure. She said he was just lucky, that was all."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“Skeletons,” Donny Ross said."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Nola sat very still, holding her coffee cup in both hands, smiling almost dazedly, accepting the tribute. She had brought some fabric with her in a paper bag—the brides often did, and Ann usually had to talk them out of it. Her fiancé had a lot of material in his home, Nola said, put away in trunks and cupboards. And there were some lovely old clothes, too; Ann should come out and see sometime. Ann made a politely interested noise, wondering if he kept a secondhand shop; she was imagining someone much older than Nola, respectable and considerate, quiet, perhaps a widower. The material in the bag smelled of mothballs, but it looked expensive—thick silk brocade, off-white, embroidered with cream flowers. “It’s old,” Nola said, “but it’s never been used. And there’s some lace, too, good lace. I didn’t bring that—I wanted to ask you first.” She fingered the brocade uneasily, staring down at it. “It’s too much, isn’t it? I’ll look like a dog’s dinner, that’s what I said. I just want to wear something sensible, look like myself. But he insisted, said I had to bring it.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"“I am lucky! Don’t I know it. I was his nurse, you know, when he was very poorly. That’s how we met. But it’s not how it sounds: that isn’t what he wants me for, just to look after him. I mean, to see him now you couldn’t tell he was ever ill, except he has a little limp, that’s all.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"One weekend that summer Sally found herself at the very scene of her mother’s stories, Thwaite Park, which was now used as a teacher-training college. Sally’s boyfriend was an art student, and he worked part time for a company that catered conferences and receptions; she helped out when they needed extra staff. She wore her jacket to Thwaite deliberately, and hung it up on a hook in the kitchen. Her job that day was mostly behind the scenes, washing plates and cups and cutlery in a deep Belfast sink, while the hot-water urn wheezed and gurgled through its cycles. The kitchen was as dark as a cave, its cream-painted walls greenish with age, erupting in mineral crusts."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Nola met Kit when she dropped in to look at Ann’s designs. She was still wearing her nurse’s uniform; she wanted to keep on working until she married. Kit went all out to win her over, and Nola sat blinking and smiling—her plain black shoes planted together on the floor, her back straight—under the assault of Kit’s mad exuberance, her flattery. Kit really was good fun; when you were with her something new and outrageous could happen at any moment. Going through the drawings, Nola was full of trepidation. The models in Ann’s designs were haughty and impossibly slender, drifting with their noses tipped up disdainfully. This was how she’d learned to draw them at art college; it was only a kind of shorthand, an aspiration. If you knew how to read the designs, they gave all the essential information about seams and darts."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"When they took their picnic outside, Blaise said that they should have seen the gardens when his mother was alive. Nola, in a funny, shapeless flowery dress, squinting and smiling into the sun, looked more like a mother than like anyone’s wife; they saw how she would restore things and bring back order. Scrambling up among birch trees in a little wood, they were out of the way of the visitors on the paths below; the bluebells were like pools of water among the trees, reflecting the sky. Ray and Donny raced like schoolboys and wrestled each other to the ground, while Kit kept up her bubbling talk, making it sound to Blaise as if she and Ann were specialists in old fabrics. Hoping for more brocade, she said, they hadn’t started yet on Nola’s dress. Blaise said they must go in search of the brocade later. There were all sorts of old clothes and fabrics and embroideries upstairs in the cedarwood presses, he told them; he’d hardly looked in there himself but would love them to discover something valuable, which he could sell. “You can help yourself to anything you like. I expect it’s all old junk. I’ll show you around properly when the public have gone. Not that I’m objecting to the public, because they are my bread and butter.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Ann and Nola had grown up on the same street in Fishponds and had both won bursary places at the same girls’ grammar school. Nola was already in her third year when Ann started, but Ann had ignored her overtures of friendship and avoided sitting next to her on the bus that took them home. She’d hoped that Nola understood about her need to make new friends and leave Fishponds behind. Nola had trained to be a district nurse when she left school, and Ann didn’t often cross paths with her; now she guessed, with a sinking heart, that Nola had come to ask her to make her wedding dress. There had been other girls from her Fishponds past who’d wanted her to do this—it wasn’t even, strictly speaking, her past, because for the moment she was still living there, at home with her family. She and Kit needed the work, but Kit said that if they were seen to be sewing for just anyone they’d never get off the ground with the right people. Perhaps when Nola knew their prices she’d be put off. Hesitating, Ann looked at her wristwatch. “Look, why don’t you come on in for ten minutes. I am busy, but I’ll take a break. I’ll put some coffee on to perk.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Kit sewed well, and she had a good eye for style; she could work hard when she put her mind to it, but she couldn’t design for toffee or cut a pattern. “Ann’s going to make my fortune for me,” she said. “You wait until we move the business up to London. We’ll be dressing all the stars of stage and screen. I’d put my life in her hands.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Ann was accomplished at congratulating other women on their engagements. She hardly felt a pang—felt instead something sprightly and audacious, more like relief. “Do you know about our prices?” she said tactfully. “I could show you a price list.”"
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"Their drunkenness ought to have ended in some shame or disaster—Ray had drunk as much as the rest of them, and he was driving them home—but it didn’t. They didn’t break any of the lovely glasses etched with vine leaves; no one threw up or said anything unforgivable; no one was killed. They didn’t even feel too bad the next day. Ray delivered the girls decorously back, eventually, to the doorsteps of their respective houses in Fishponds and Stoke Bishop. On the way home, Kit said what a sweetheart Blaise was—and what a fabulous place, imagine landing that! Didn’t Ann just wish she’d got to him first, before Nola Higgins? Then Ann, with her drunken special insight, said that Blaise wasn’t really what he seemed. He wasn’t actually very easy. He’d seen right through them and he didn’t like them very much. He saw how they condescended to Nola, even if Nola didn’t see it. Kit said indignantly that she’d never condescended to anybody in her life."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			“Ann? Do you remember me? It’s Nola.”
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"They drank his champagne anyway, from eighteenth-century glasses, which they’d brought from the house because Blaise couldn’t find anything else. When the champagne was finished, Kit brought out a bottle of her father’s Armagnac—“I won’t half be in trouble,” she said—and they started in on that. And somehow that afternoon they achieved that miraculous drunkenness you get only once or twice in a lifetime, brilliant and without consequences, not peaking and subsiding but running weightlessly on and on. Afterward, Ann could hardly remember any subject they’d talked about, or what had seemed so clever or so funny. When they wandered on the grounds in the evening, after the public had gone, Nola took off her black shoes and walked carefree in her stockings. And Donny Ross’s pursuit of Ann was as intent and tense as a stalking cat’s: invisible to everyone else, it seemed to her to flash through all the disparate, hazy successive phases of the afternoon like a sparking, dangerous live wire. They lay close together but not touching, in the long grass under a tall ginkgo tree, whose leaves were shaped like exquisite tiny paddles, translucent bright grass-green. The light faded in the sky to a deep turquoise and the peacocks came to roost in the tree above them, clotted lumps of darkness, with their long tails hanging down like bellpulls."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"So Kit and Ann drove out one Sunday, with Ray and Donny Ross, for a picnic at Thwaite Park. Kit was engaged to Ray by this time, though Ann didn’t take that too seriously; she’d been engaged several times already, and, anyway, Ann knew that the other thing was still going on with Kit’s married man, Charlie, who was a lawyer. Ann had bumped into Charlie recently, out shopping with his wife and children. She’d been waltzing around the fitting room with him only the night before, while Kit played Edith Piaf on the portable Black Box gramophone he’d bought her, yet when he passed her in the street he pretended not to know her, staring at her blankly. His wife was hanging on to his arm, and Charlie held his gloves in his clasped hands behind his back; as Ann looked after them, he waggled his free fingers at her in a jaunty, naughty secret signal."
Silk Brocade	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/27/silk-brocade			"He got up while Kit was still talking and went into the kitchenette, banging through the cupboards, looking for something he didn’t find—alcohol, probably; he came out with the bag of sugar and a cup of the coffee that Ann had made for Nola earlier, which must have been quite cold. Then he sat spooning sugar out of the bag into his cup, no saucer, spilling it all over the table, six or seven spoonfuls just to make the coffee bearable, and Kit didn’t say a word about the sugar bag, though she was so particular about everything being served up in the right way. Perhaps Donny Ross frightened her, Ann thought."

The Apartment	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-apartment			"Louise knew by the new name on the call box that someone had moved in. She’d seen lights and movement in the apartment, which was across the courtyard from her and Martin, for the past few days. The new name confirmed it. Someone had finally bought the place. The name had been typed on a small piece of green paper and taped to the call box beside the apartment’s number. Louise had once known a man with the name Jahani. Arman had been a doctoral student in French the year she started at Stockholm University. He’d taught the conversation tutorial she took fall term. She looked at the green paper again. All that was so long ago. He was the second man she’d slept with. Martin still didn’t know about it. She checked her watch. She was on her way out to meet her son, Jonas, for lunch. The metro she wanted to take was due in ten minutes. Arman had come from Iran to study, or maybe he’d come to escape the revolution. She couldn’t recall the details now. The years merged into one another. A bus rushed past on the street, and the blast of hot air stung her neck."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Can’t pay attention?” He looked to his mother to see if that was the correct answer.
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“I guess so.”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"They crossed a creek on a noisy bridge where telephone poles had been stacked. Just beyond was an empty house and a car on blocks, then the road climbed slowly on a straightaway toward the first lights they had seen in a long time. As they approached, the driver slowed down, holding the top of his head with one hand: a sheriff’s car was parked there, and several officers stood on either side of the road near it. “An accident? Doesn’t seem like there’s enough cars to have one.” The driver rolled his window down. “But this is good, son. Maybe you’ll talk to these fellers.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Hi.”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"It occurred to Spencer that this was like school: he was always tongue-tied just when people wanted to help him. It would all get worked out at Bayreuth, he told himself, even if it was closed at this hour. His mother would take over the situation. She hadn’t meant to forget him and would soon have him back with his aquarium. Today was Thursday, and sometimes on Fridays his father brought him a fish in a water-filled zip-lock bag. Last time, it had been a Siamese fighting fish upside down in the bag, and it had had to go down the toilet. Then his dad had done some research and explained to Spencer that until they got a better bubbler they really couldn’t get another fish. So they got one with a little deep-sea diver with bubbles coming out of his helmet, but so far no new fish."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Spencer felt anxious trying to come up with a plausible answer. The driver had put the car in gear but took it out again and sat back and crossed his arms. Under pressure, Spencer wanted to blink. Finally, he said, “Bayreuth.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Hi, Spencer.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“I wish you’d say something. You want to play the radio? You want me to play the radio? O.K., no radio.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“I’ll raise his standards in my own way. I have tickets to Bayreuth, and I shall take Spencer with me this year. No one leaves Wagner unimproved.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			The car stopped under the “LIVE WELL—PHARMACY—PHOTO CENTER” sign. “Is this it?” No one in sight. The pulsing red neon reflected off the dashboard and lit the side of the driver’s face. Spencer needed his mother here to do the talking.
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Yes, yes, put it back now. I have a permit for that. I need it. I’m a travelling salesman. Thank you.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“School is closed, too! O.K., please don’t cry. I shouldn’t have raised my voice, but this is getting to be a problem. There’s a Buy Rite Auto on the frontage road. That sound like it? No?” The driver gripped the wheel hard, then rested his head on it. “Please tell me where to take you. Stop, don’t open the glove compartment!”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Maybe back to the school.”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"A car turned onto the dark end of the street, and as its headlights hit Spencer it slowed to a crawl. Its lights were so bright that he covered his eyes until the car drew alongside him. Still blinded, Spencer could see no more than the outline of a man’s head in the driver’s window. It seemed a long time before the driver spoke. “Hello, son, you look like you could use a ride. Care to hop in?”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Who?”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"When Spencer opened the door to get in, the interior light came on, showing an older man with a white crewcut that stood straight up, wearing a buttoned sweater with a picture of an elk in its wool. Spencer got only a quick look, because when he closed the door the light went off and the man was just an outline again."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"He managed, “Maybe not.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“When you’re old enough and have received proper training. So, now where are we headed? Son, tell me the truth, do you actually want to go home?”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Oh, boy, how were you raised, anyway? That’s not a plaything.” The man reached over and took the gun from Spencer. “I tried to help you. My conscience is clear. Out you go.” Spencer gripped the seat and didn’t budge. He wanted to keep going down the road. The man’s voice came in a roar. “Get the fuck out now before I hit you over the head! You’re starting to scare me.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“I see. What do you think is best?”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"He hadn’t seen this street before. Of all the houses along it, only two had lights bright enough to show where the sidewalk was. Spencer looked back and tried to remember how many turns he had made and why he thought he had been heading toward more lights instead of fewer. He stopped. His hat was in his desk at school, and his head was getting cold, but the idea of knocking on a stranger’s door to ask for a hat swept him with shyness and desperation."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Son, you gotta help me. Where do you want to go? I was supposed to be at the Legion ten minutes ago.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Anyway, I think it might be in Spencer’s best interest to let him enjoy a spell in special ed—get the pressure off him a bit and let him spread his wings.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Such was Mrs. Quantrill’s standing that her appearance in the grade-school principal’s office, with the then nine-year-old Spencer in tow, required a bit of fanfare, which she provided by doffing her coat and abruptly removing her lovely gloves a finger at a time. Back then, before such people concealed their prominence, it was not unusual to dress up even for small occasions such as this one. Mrs. Quantrill was the tallest person in the room and very thin, with unblinking blue eyes. Spencer hovered beside her as Mr. Cooper, the principal, in a tan suit and referee’s whistle, directed them to two chairs, then sidled behind his desk and sat down, fingers laced under his chin."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			Spencer couldn’t speak.
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Spencer sat with his tennis shoes one atop the other and pushed his hair across his forehead. He seemed not to know what to do with his feet, his eyes, or his hands."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Where are we headed, young man?”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			The driver leaned over to thrust open the passenger door. “Get in.”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"After watching his mother leave the school parking lot without him, Spencer first considered going back into the school, but trying to explain to Mr. Cooper or anyone else how his mother just got caught up in her thoughts seemed to be beyond him. He was sure that if he waited she would eventually realize she had forgotten him, but standing there alone would have people wondering about him, so he set out walking, though it was almost dark and getting cold. If she hadn’t driven off so fast, he would have been in his bedroom by now with his aquarium light turned on, the guppies and angelfish swimming around the bubbler or darting for the flakes of food he dropped."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Wagner!”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Then the lights of the distant car seemed to circle, and Spencer saw that it was coming back. He looked quickly to his left and to his right, but he couldn’t move."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“I wasn’t scared.”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			Spencer didn’t know what to say and so said nothing.
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			Spencer did so and closed the door.
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Mr. Cooper fingered the whistle as though noticing it for the first time and declined to answer. “I think Spencer wants to participate and enjoy things, but he often seems . . . stunned.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"On the radio, in the papers, but mostly in people’s mouths, news of the kidnapper ballooned. In town, the driver’s relatives were dismayed to learn of this side of his character and anxious to put some distance between them and him. The interrogator from Helena was delayed by a passing hailstorm, and by the time he got to the town jail the driver had done away with himself, an expression that Spencer failed to understand and which his mother explained by using her hands to illustrate a bird flying off. Even so, he suspected that he was being misled. Now the newscasters were full of questions as to whether it had been mothball- or golf-ball-size hail. A widow up at Ten Mile went on TV with a hailstone the size of a grapefruit, but subsequent investigation revealed it to be something from her freezer. ?"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Thank you for coming, Mrs. Quantrill. Spencer’s struggling. Aren’t you, Spencer?”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Son, I can’t leave you out here by yourself. Something might happen to you.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Special ed?” Mrs. Quantrill got to her feet, eyes flashing, plucked her coat from the back of her chair, and said, “Over my dead body.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Ah.”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"In the car, Mrs. Quantrill spoke non-stop. She glanced down Main Street and remarked, “What a hole.” It was nearly dark, and most of the small businesses there were being closed and locked by their owners. “Mr. Cooper means well, Spencer. He wants to help you, and he’s correct in noticing that your grades are not what they should be. That wretched water-bed outlet is finally going out of business! But we all develop at different speeds, and though I was tall and strong and popular at your age, your father was small and fearful, and just look how he turned out. The mighty oak, single acorn, et cetera. And, my angel, you’re going to love Bayreuth, this year especially, because we will see ‘Parsifal,’ and you’ll find out why Mommy calls you that, and you will be strengthened and return to school with something new that will be felt by everyone—students, teachers, and even nice Mr. Cooper, with that dopey whistle, who thought you should be in special ed. So let’s break the news to Daddy: it’s summer in Bavaria for all of us. Look, Spencer, there’s that place where Daddy bought those Italian snow tires. Why did Daddy think Italians would know how to make snow tires? When he slid off the road in front of the airport, he found out how much they know! You probably think I was pretty rude to the principal, what’s his name, but no, Spencer, I was only being direct. I’m not a bad person. I thought the faster he knew my feelings the better. I’m just going to let this policeman pass me. I don’t like feeling that I’m being followed, no matter who it is. Spencer, you’re too quiet, and it makes me think you’re disapproving. Are you asleep back there?”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Someday, I’ll have a gun.” And a big mustache, he thought."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“It’s quite a ways.”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“You don’t know enough to be scared! God almighty!” As the car pulled forward, Spencer looked longingly into the dark. He thought of his mother and wondered if she would remember to feed the fish. He pictured them at the surface of the aquarium looking up at him, expecting to be fed. “As soon as we get to some town, I’m going to find a phone. Yes sirree, Bob, I’m gonna find me a phone and figure out where you belong.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Spencer opened the door, hoping the driver would change his mind, then got out and closed the door. He had wanted to speak, but as he searched through his mind nothing came to him. It was wonderful how the night smelled and how huge the stars seemed as the car pulled slowly away, pushing open a strip of road with its headlights. Once the sound of its motor had faded, a roar of insects filled the emptiness. Spencer was very still as he followed his happiness to its source and smiled to think, No one knows where I am. The driver was a nice man, but maybe this is better."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“What’s the whistle for?” she asked the principal.
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Stunned?” Mrs. Quantrill said. “Hardly.” Spencer reversed the order of his tennis shoes, placing his left foot on top of his right."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Two officers came to the driver’s door. They looked hard through the window at Spencer, glanced at each other, pulled open the door, dragged the driver onto the road, and handcuffed him behind his back. The opposite door opened, and Spencer was swept into the arms of a burly deputy. There were lights everywhere, and Spencer cried, but not for the reasons the worried lawmen believed."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Is it loaded?”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“You describe it, Spencer.”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“There’s the road,” Spencer said, pointing to a road that angled off to the west, a road he had never seen before."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"“Buy-Rite? Jeez, that’s way on the other side of town. And it’s closed. Is someone picking you up at Buy-Rite?”"
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Soon, all the houses dropped away into the dark. It was possible to see the shapes of bluffs and, well back from the road and barely different from the stars, the occasional yard light at a ranch. A jackrabbit paused, lit up in the headlights, then vanished. For a while, the only sound was the pop of bugs against the windshield. The car came to a stop in the middle of the road, and the driver scratched his crewcut frantically with both hands, then covered his face. “I can see it now—kidnapping, child molester, the whole nine yards. Son, you have to get out of the car.” When he uncovered his face, Spencer was playing with the gun again."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			"Mrs. Quantrill lived in a beautiful old Prairie-style house built in the twenties, which she had restored to its original elegance with Mr. Quantrill, a patent attorney attached to Montana’s burgeoning natural-gas industry. Mrs. Quantrill had raised all kinds of hell getting the house listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Quantrills were known for their philanthropy and for elegant parties, featuring such high jinks as horses in the living room and mock gunfights on the lawn. Hereditary landowners who no longer lived on their land, they plied it for energy leases. They hung on to their cattle brands long after the last cow had gone down the road, beautiful single-iron brands from territorial days. When their son, Spencer, inherited the house many years later, he demolished it and replaced it with storage units. Even these fell into disrepair, and it was hard to know if they produced any income, because Spencer, who’d temporarily lived in one of the units, had long since moved away."
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Better tell me where or I’ll run out of gas idling here like this.”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“How far?”
The Driver	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/28/the-driver-fiction-thomas-mcguane			“Struggling how?” Mrs. Quantrill asked sharply.

At four, Jim persuaded his wife, Annie, to go out to do her shopping before full darkness fell. He closed the door behind her with a gentle wave. His hair was thinning, and he was missing a canine on the right side, but he was nevertheless a handsome man who, at thirty-two, might have passed for twenty. Heavy brows and deep-set, dark-lashed eyes that had been making women catch their breath since he was sixteen. Even if he’d grown bald and toothless, the eyes would have served him long into his old age."

For the wake. And buried first thing tomorrow morning.” She shook her jowls. She was a mannish, ugly woman, humorless, severe, but an excellent nurse. “Tomorrow!” Sister Lucy said again. “Calvary. She’s got it all arranged. And why is she rushing him into the ground?” She shivered a bit, then declared, “You can’t pull strings with God. You can’t pull the wool over God’s eyes.”"

Lamplight was reflected as well on the rump of a fire truck, and on the pale faces of a gathered crowd, with an extra sparkle on those who wore glasses—Sister St. Savior, for instance, a Little Sister of the Sick Poor, who had spent the afternoon collecting alms in the vestibule of the Woolworth’s at Borough Hall. She was now on her way back to the convent, her bladder full, her ankles swollen, her round lenses turned toward the street light and the terrible scent of doused fire on the winter air."

The bed was made, the blankets smoothed, no trace of fire in here, although there was more soot along the far wall. No trace, either, of where the husband might have lain on the bed. She knew immediately—it was the sympathy in his gestures, toward the girl on the bed, toward the apartment above—that it was the short police officer who had come back, after the body had been removed, to smooth and straighten the counterpane. One of us."

Playfully lifted the hose to one eye, as if to see along its length the black corridor of a subway tunnel, lit gold at the end by the station ahead. Then he closed his eyes and swallowed. Outside, a mother called to a child. There was the slow clopping of a horse-drawn cart. Something dropped to the floor in the apartment upstairs—a sewing basket, perhaps. There was a thud and then a scratchy chorus of wooden spools spinning. Or maybe it was coins, spilled from a fallen purse."

A man over in Jersey, playing billiards in his home, accidentally opened the gas tap in the room, with the pole they use, the cue, it says, and asphyxiated himself.” She raised her chin. “His poor wife called him for dinner and found him gone. Day before yesterday. Mr. Sheen mentioned it to me this morning. He was pointing out how common these things are. These accidents with the gas.”"

Obediently, the young nun gathered the linens from the couch. Sister St. Savior went with her to the vestibule and then watched her walk delicately down the stone stairs, the bundle held to one side so that she could see her tiny feet as she descended. Sister Jeanne was small and slight, but there was a firmness about her, a buoyancy, perhaps, as she hurried away, the bundle in her arms, so much to do. She was of an age, Sister St. Savior understood, when tragedy was no less thrilling than romance."

He lifted it and rolled it lengthwise against his thighs. Then he fitted it over the threshold, tucking the cloth of the sleeves and the hem as well as he could into the space beneath the door. Theirs was a railroad flat: kitchen in the back, then dining room, living room, and bedroom in the front. He needed only to push the heavy couch a few feet along the wall to block his wife’s return. He stood on the seat to check that the glass transom above the door was closed. Then he stepped down. He straightened the lace on the back of the couch and brushed away the shallow impression his foot had made on the horsehair cushion."

"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"His trouble was with time. Bad luck for a trainman, even on the B.R.T. His trouble was that he liked to refuse time. He delighted in refusing it. He would come to the end of a long night, to the inevitability of 5 a.m., and, while other men, poor sheep, gave in every morning, turning from the pleasures of sleep or drink or talk or love to the duties of the day, he would continue as he willed. “I’m not going,” he’d murmur. “I won’t be constrained.” Two weeks ago, he’d been discharged for unreliability and insubordination. The man Jim was inside—not the blushing, humiliated boy who’d stood ham-handed before the bosses—had shaken off the blow and turned away. But Annie had wept when he told her, and then said angrily, through her tears, that there was a baby coming, knowing even as she said it that to break the news to him in this way was to condemn the child to a life of trouble."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"She wanted the man buried in Calvary to give comfort to his poor wife, true. To get the girl what she’d paid for. But she also wanted to prove herself something more than a beggar, here at the end of her usefulness. She would get him buried in Calvary if only because the Church wanted him out, and she, who had spent her life in service to the Church, wanted him in. “Hold it against the good I’ve done,” she prayed. “We’ll sort it out when I see You.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister St. Savior pushed the undertaker’s hand away. She thought of the young man with the milk tooth and the gray fedora. “The New York Times,” she said, “has a big mouth.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"She could tell herself that the illusion was purposeful: God showing her an image of the young man, the suicide, trapped in his bitter purgatory. But she refused the notion. It was superstition. It was the Devil himself who had drawn her eyes down, who had brushed her heart with despair. That was the truth of it."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"She carried the pile of bedding down the narrow stairs. Sister Lucy was still sunk into herself, breathing deeply. Sister St. Savior dropped the linens on the couch beside her and, when that didn’t get her to stir, she touched the Sister’s black shoe with her own—and felt the keenness of the repeated motion, the man’s empty shoe upstairs and Sister Lucy’s here, still filled with its owner’s mortal foot. “I’d like you to sit with the lady,” she said."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"“That’s quick,” Sister Jeanne said. She hesitated and then added, “Sister Lucy wonders why it’s such a rush.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"In the bedroom, the young nun—Sister Jeanne was her name—had her rosary in her hand and her eyes on the pile of blankets and coats under which the girl slept. Sister St. Savior signalled to her from the door, and she and Sister Lucy changed places. In the parlor, Sister St. Savior told Sister Jeanne that she was to take the bedclothes to the convent for washing and return with a bucket and broom. The two of them were going to scrub the apartment upstairs, roll up the wet rug, dry the floors, and repair what they could, to soften the blow of the woman’s return to the place where the accident had occurred, because return she would, with nowhere else to go and a baby on the way."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The two nuns climbed the stairs again. Inside, they coaxed the sobbing girl up off her knees and into the bed. It was Sister Jeanne who took over then—no weariness in her narrow shoulders, no indication at all that she felt the tedium of too much sympathy for a stranger. With Annie settled, she told Sister St. Savior to go back to the convent to rest. She said she would keep vigil through the long night and have the lady ready first thing in the morning."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The apartment was filled with people and the heavy drone of whispered conversation. There were two groups: one was gathered around a middle-aged man in shirtsleeves and carpet slippers who was sitting in a chair by the window, his face in his hands. The other, across the room, was tending to a woman stretched out on a dark couch, under a fringed lamp that was not lit. She had a cloth applied to her forehead, but she seemed to be speaking sensibly to the thin young man who leaned over her. When she saw the nun, the woman raised a limp hand and said, “She’s in the bedroom, Sister.” Her arm from wrist to elbow was glistening with a shiny salve—butter, perhaps."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The baby, a daughter, was born in August. She was called Sally, but christened St. Savior in honor of the Sister’s kindness that sad afternoon. The damp and gray afternoon when the pilot went out. When her young father, a motorman for the B.R.T. whose grave she never found, sent her mother to do the shopping while he had himself a little nap. ?"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"It was Sister St. Savior’s vocation to enter the homes of strangers, mostly the sick and the elderly, to breeze into their apartments and sail comfortably through their rooms, to open their linen closets or their china cabinets or their bureau drawers, but the frequency with which she inserted herself into the homes of strangers had not diminished over the years her initial impulse to shade her eyes. She dipped her head as she passed through the parlor into a narrow corridor, but she saw enough to conclude that this was the home of a Jewish woman: the woman on the couch, she was certain; Jewish, she guessed, because of the fringed lampshade, the upright piano against the far wall, the dark oil paintings in the narrow hallway that seemed to depict two ordinary peasants, not saints. A place unprepared for visitors, arrested, as things so often were, by crisis and tragedy, in the midst of what should have been a private hour. She saw, as she passed by, that there was a plate on the small table in the kitchen, that it contained half a piece of bread, bitten and stained with a dark gravy. A glass of tea on the edge of a folded newspaper."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Once, early in her novitiate, the nun had been sent to a squalid apartment filled with wretched children, where a skeletal woman, made old, discolored, barely human, by pain, was in the last throes of her disease. “There’s nothing to be done,” Sister Miriam had advised before they opened the door. And then, as they entered—there was the tremendous animal odor of decay, the woman’s hoarse moans, the famished children’s fraught silence—she added, “Do what you can.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"He took the tea towels she had left to dry by the sink, wound them into ropes, and placed them along the windowsill. He carried the length of rubber tubing through the living room and into the bedroom. He slipped off his shoes and put the tube to his mouth as if to pull smoke. He had seen this in a picture book somewhere: a fat sultan on a red pillow, doing much the same. He sat on the edge of the bed. He bowed his head and prayed: now and at the hour of our death. He lay back on the bed. He noticed that the room had grown dimmer still. Hour of our. Our hour. He remembered his mother, the picture book spread out on her wide lap. Within this very hour he would put his head on her shoulder once again. Or would he? Would this effort to prove himself his own man—to prove that the hours of his life belonged to himself alone—bar him from Heaven? Did he believe in Heaven? There were moments when his faith fell out from under him like a trapdoor."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister Jeanne poured the milky tea into a cup and set it on the table. “It’s still awfully cold in here, Sister,” she said."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"At four o’clock, the black hearse arrived and the coffin was carried up the stairs by Mr. Sheen and his assistants. The husband’s face was pale and waxen but it was, nevertheless, a lovely face. Boyish and solemn above the starched white collar, with a kind of youthful stubbornness about it as well. The look of a child, Sister St. Savior thought, confronting a spoon of castor oil."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Later, two of the sisters from the convent arrived with more blankets and two hot-water bottles wrapped in rags, and a dinner of biscuits and cheese and hot tea, which Sister St. Savior ate in the chair she had pulled up to the side of the bed. Then she dozed with her rosary in her gloved hands and dreamed, because of the cold, no doubt, and the familiar, icy ache of it in her toes, that she was on her stool in the vestibule of Woolworth’s. She startled awake twice because, in her dream, the woven basket, full of coins, was sliding off her lap."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Down in the street, there was a good deal of movement. Dark coats and hats. A baby buggy or two, the wheels churning up a pale spray. When he turned back to the room, the light had failed in every corner, and he had to put out his hand to feel his way around the bed to his own side."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Of course, it was Sister Jeanne who would be here when the baby arrived, Sister Jeanne who had been sent for."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Later, the two nuns walked Mr. Sheen downstairs, in order to give the girl some time alone with her husband. On the street, he reached into the cab of the hearse and pulled out the day’s newspaper. He folded back a page and tapped a narrow article. Sister St. Savior leaned forward to read, Sister Jeanne at her elbow. In the descending light of the cold evening, the two could just make out the headline: “Suicide Endangers Others.” It was followed by a full report of the fire and the man’s death by his own hand. “There’s nothing to be done, Sister,” Mr. Sheen whispered. “Now that it’s in the paper, there’s not a Catholic cemetery that will have him.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister smiled. “Is that so?” she said. They both knew he was lying. No one had called for her. She had been on her way home, merely passing by. She dipped her head again, forgiving him his vanity—hadn’t he said, too, that he’d put out the fire himself? “I’ll go to her, then,” she said."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The house where the fire had been looked startled: the windows of all four floors were wide open, shade cords and thin curtains flailing in the cold wind. Although the rest of the building was dark, the vestibule at the top of the stone stoop was weirdly lit, crowded with policemen and firemen carrying lamps. Sister St. Savior wanted only to walk on, to get to her convent, her room, her toilet, but still she brushed through the crowd and climbed the steps. There was a limp fire hose running along the shadowy base of the bannister. Two of the officers in the hallway, turning to see her, tipped their hats and put out their hands as if she had been summoned. “Sister,” one of them said. He was flushed and perspiring, and even in the dull light she could see that the cuffs of his jacket were singed. “Right in here.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			“What’s the girl’s name?” she asked.
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"She went to the single window in the narrow kitchen. The courtyard below was full of shadow; looking down into it disheartened her in a way that she was unprepared for. She sat on the sill, lifted the twisted tea towel that had been left there. Outside, most of the facing windows were still dark, only a small light here and there: an early worker, a mother with an infant, a bedside vigil. Reluctantly, she cast her eyes down into the courtyard again. The sun would have to be well up in the sky to light that gloomy tangle, but, even at this hour, there was a variation in the shadows that caught her attention. It was the movement of birds, or of a stalking cat, or a patch of puddled rainwater briefly reflecting the coming dawn, but for just a moment she thought it was a man, crawling—“cowering” was the word—beneath the snarl of junk and dead leaves, the vague early light just catching the perspiration on his wide brow, the gleam of a tooth or an eye."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The officer frowned. “Mc-Something. Annie they called her. Irish extraction,” he added. “That’s why I thought to call for you.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			Sister St. Savior then headed down the steps herself. Sheen’s funeral parlor was only eight blocks over.
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			“Where?”
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister accepted the information with only a discreet nod. When she looked up again—her eyes behind her glasses were small and brown and caught the light the way only a hard surface would, marble or black tin, nothing watery—the truth of the suicide was both acknowledged and put away. She had entered the homes of strangers and seen the bottles in the bin, the poor contents of a cupboard, the bruise in a hidden place, seen as well, once, a pale, thumb-size infant in a basin filled with blood and had bowed her head and nodded in just the same way."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister St. Savior left the two of them in the bedroom. At the casket, she paused again to look at the young man’s face. The stubbornness had drained away; it was only lifeless now. She went into the kitchen and glanced down into the purgatory of the back yard. At this hour, all movement was in the lighted windows above: a man at a table, a child with a bedside lamp, a young woman walking an infant to and fro."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister St. Savior laughed. “True enough.” Her smile was as smooth as paint. “The Devil loves these short, dark days.” She went on, “Mr. Sheen said, as a matter of fact, that he could show the article about the billiard man to anyone in the Church, or at the cemetery, in case there was a question. To show how common these sorts of accidents were. And how easily they could be misinterpreted. This New Jersey man, after all, had come home early from work. And closed the door. Had he been a poor man, not a man with a billiard table at all, they might have made a different report out of it. The rich can get whatever they want put into the papers.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The girl raised one hand from her stomach and clutched the crown of her hair. “He lost his job,” she said. “They let him go. The B.R.T. He was at odd ends.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"It wasn’t until they’d all cleared out, and well before Dr. Hannigan arrived, that Sister allowed herself to use the toilet. Then she helped Annie undress and get comfortable in Mrs. Gertler’s bed. When Dr. Hannigan came, she held a candle over his shoulder while he examined the girl, put a stethoscope to her belly and her rising chest. As he was leaving, she asked him to go by the convent to tell them where she was—“So they don’t think I’ve been murdered.” And to, please, as well, go by the morgue to tell them that Sheen and Sons Funeral Home would be making the arrangements. She bent her head back to see him better, to make sure that her small black eyes were right on his own. There were some details, she added, that she’d ask him to keep to himself."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Inside the shadowed bedroom, the neighbor woman who stood at the bedside had her eyes elsewhere, on the gloaming at the far side of the cluttered room. No doubt there were children waiting for their dinner, a husband to be placated. A woman with a family of her own, with troubles of her own, could not be expected to attend to the sorrows of another indefinitely. The nun motioned to her: they would exchange places."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The officer glanced over his shoulder, toward the bed, and then took the Sister’s elbow and walked her out to the narrow hall. Now they stood in the kitchen doorway. “He killed himself,” the officer whispered, his breath sour, as if in reaction to the situation he was obliged to report. “Turned on the gas. Lucky he didn’t take everyone else with him.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"This much the nun was certain of: the girl’s husband had cherished his wife with the beautiful hair. Love was not the problem. Money, more likely. Alcohol. Madness. The day and time itself: late afternoon in early February, was there a moment of the year better suited for despair? God Himself was helpless against it—Sister St. Savior believed this. She believed that God had held His head in His hands while the young man in the apartment above was slipping off this gray life—collar and yoke. God had wept, she believed this, even as she was getting off her chair in the lobby of Woolworth’s an hour before her usual time, even as she was climbing the stone steps, footsore and weary and needing a toilet, but going up anyway, although no one had sent for her."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"While Annie and Sister Jeanne knelt, Sister St. Savior blessed herself and considered the sin of her deception, slipping a suicide into hallowed ground. A man who had rejected his life, the love of this brokenhearted girl, the child coming to them in the summer. She said to God, who knew her thoughts, “Hold it against me if You will.” He could put this day on the side of the ledger where all her sins were listed: the hatred she felt for certain politicians, the money she sometimes stole from her own basket to give out as she pleased—to a girl with a raging case of the clap, to the bruised wife of a drunk, to the mother of the thumb-size infant, which she had wrapped in a clean handkerchief, baptized, and then buried in the convent garden. All the moments of how many days when her compassion failed, her patience failed, when her love for God’s people could not outrun the girlish alacrity of her scorn for their stupidity, their petty sins."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"When the woman was gone, Sister reached inside her cloak and took the small basket from under her arm. It was a flimsy thing, woven of unblessed palms, and much the worse for being crushed against her body for so long. She straightened and reshaped it a bit, catching as she did the green scent that the warmth of her flesh and the work of her hands could sometimes coax from the dried reeds. She placed it on the table beside the bed and untied the money pouch from her belt. It was all coins today, mostly pennies. She placed the pouch in the basket and then sat carefully on the side of the bed, her kidneys aching, her feet throbbing inside her shoes. She was sixty-four that year, and the stiffness in her back and her knees and the arthritis in her hands on these damp days had begun to limit her usefulness. More and more she was sent out with her basket to beg, rather than to nurse. She kept her dissatisfaction with the arrangement to herself, which meant that she complained only to God, who knew how she felt. Who had sent her here."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			“How long were you and Jim married?” the nun asked. She understood that there was some small resurrection in just speaking the man’s name.
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"A policeman and a fireman were conferring with another man in the hallway by the stairs. They all turned and nodded to Sister Jeanne as she came through the vestibule. The door to the parlor apartment was ajar, and she let herself in. She crossed the living room and entered the narrow corridor with its two portraits of dour peasants, and found Sister St. Savior in the tiny kitchen. Sister Jeanne placed the broom against the door and carried the bucket to the table where the old nun sat. The kitchen had been scrubbed; the only trace of Mrs. Gertler’s dinner was the newspaper that had been folded beside her plate. Sister St. Savior now had it wide open before her."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"She felt a beggar’s envy. She envied the young nun, true enough—a new sin for her side of the ledger. But she envied as well the coming dawn, still so many hours away. She envied the very day, when those who have despaired lie trapped in the featureless dark, while the young, the believing, bustle on, one foot in front of the other, so much to do."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"In the dining room, the sideboard was as big as a boat. She found the couple’s lease and marriage license before she put her hand on the narrow blue folder on which someone had written—it was a man’s severe script—“Deed for Calvary.” She slipped it into her pocket."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"An hour later, when Mrs. Gertler returned to reclaim her apartment, Annie was up and dressed and sitting in a chair by the window with one of Sister Jeanne’s handkerchiefs clutched in both hands. The two nuns walked up the stairs with her, Sister Jeanne ahead and Sister St. Savior just behind."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister lifted the two pillows, slipped off their cases, then pulled off the sheets and the blankets, and said to God, “As You made us,” at the familiar sight of the rusty stains on the blue ticking of the mattress. She pushed the sheets into one of the pillowcases and wrapped a blanket around them. As she stepped away with the linens in her arms, she kicked something, and looked over her shoulder to see what it was. A man’s shoe, broad brown leather, well worn. There were two of them at the end of the bed. Gaping and forlorn, the black laces wildly trailing. She nudged them with her toe until they were safely hidden."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"She looked at the girl’s dark form, the length of her back and the curve of her young hip. Suddenly, the girl turned in the bed and threw herself into the Sister’s lap, weeping. Sister St. Savior put her hand to the girl’s dark hair. It was thick, and as soft as silk. She lifted the heavy knot of it and then brushed a strand from her cheek."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister nodded. All right. God had His head out of His hands now, at least. He knew the future. There would be a baby to care for in the summer. And, for once, she would not foist the diapering and the spitting up onto one of the younger nuns. She nearly smiled. Out of the depths—the phrase came to her like a fresh scent on the air—comes the promise of a baby. A green scent coaxed out of dried reeds."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"“You might leave off with that grease,” Sister said. “Unless you’re determined to be basted.” The young man turned at this. He wore a gray fedora and had a milk tooth in his grin. “Have the courtesy to doff your hat,” she told him."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"In the parlor, they all turned to Sister St. Savior as if she had indeed been summoned to direct the proceedings. It was agreed that the lady of the house—Gertler was her name—would spend the night with her sister-in-law, across the street. Since the gas had been turned off, and would not be turned on again until tomorrow, most of the building’s occupants were clearing out for the evening. In the vestibule, neighbors were coming down the dark staircase with bedding and small satchels. Sister sent word with one of them to the owner of a boarding house nearby: the middle-aged neighbor would go there. The thin young man in the hat had already left, so she asked Officer O’Neil to knock on the door of one Dr. Hannigan. “Mention my name,” she said. “He’ll roll his eyes, but he’ll come.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"In the kitchen, he pressed his cheek to the cold enamel of the stove and slid his hand into the tight space between it and the yellow wall until he found the rubber hose that connected the oven to the gas tap. He pulled at it as vigorously as he could, given the confined space. There was a satisfying pop, and a hiss that quickly faded. He straightened up with the hose in his hand. The kitchen window looked into the gray courtyard, where, on better days, there were lines of clothes baking in the sun, although the floor of the courtyard, even in the prettiest weather, was a junk yard and a jungle. There were rats and bedsprings and broken crates, a tangle of city-bred vegetation. Once, Annie, sitting on the windowsill with a clothespin in her mouth and a basket of wet linen at her feet, saw a man drag a small child through the muck and tie him to the pole that held the line. She watched the man take off his belt, and, with the first crack of it against the child’s bare calves, she began to yell. Leaning halfway out the window, she threatened to call the police, the fire department, the Gerrity Society. The man glanced up briefly, as if noticing a change in the weather, and then untied the sobbing child and dragged him away. “I know who you are,” Annie cried. Although she didn’t. When Jim ran into the kitchen at the sound of her shouting, she was out the window to her waist, with only one toe on the kitchen floor. He’d had to put his hands on her hips to ease her out of danger. Just one more of what had turned out to be too many days that he hadn’t gone in to work or had arrived too late for his shift."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Now the girl pulled away and raised her face to the dim light. She was neither as young nor as pretty as Sister had imagined. It was a plain, round face, swollen with tears. “Where will I bury him?” she asked. In her eyes, the nun saw the determination—not a result of the Sister’s admonition but, rather, what the woman herself was made of—to put one foot in front of the other. “We’ve got a plot in Calvary,” the girl said. “We got it when we were married. But the Church will never allow it now.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister St. Savior moved the cup closer without raising it. “The men have just been in to turn on the gas,” she said. “I asked them to carry out a few things that were damaged in the fire. They’re going to wash down the walls for me as well. So we’ve made some progress.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"He stood up. Found his nightshirt beneath his pillow and twisted it, too. Then placed it along the edge of the bedroom window, again pushing the material into the narrow crevice where the frame met the sill, knowing all the while that the gesture was both ineffectual and unnecessary."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"In her forty-seven years of living in this city, Sister had collected any number of acquaintances who could help surmount the many rules and regulations—Church rules and city rules and what Sister Miriam called the rules of polite society—that complicated the lives of women: Catholic women in particular, and poor women in general. Her own little Tammany, Sister Miriam called it. If it was all done quickly enough, Sister St. Savior knew she could get this woman’s husband buried in Calvary."

She carried a broom and a bucket that contained both a scrub brush and breakfast: a jar of tea, bread, butter, and jam, all wrapped in a towel. As she reached the building, Sister Lucy was just coming down the steps, pulling her cloak around her hips and turning down the corners of her mouth as if the two motions were somehow connected—some necessary accommodation to what Sister Jeanne saw immediately was her ferocious anger."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"In the candlelit bedroom, two more policemen were conferring in a corner. There were dark stockings hung over the back of a chair, a gray corset on the threadbare carpet at the foot of the bed. There was a girl on the bed, her face to the wall, her dark skirt spread out around her, as if she had fallen there from some height. Another woman leaned over her, a hand on the girl’s shoulder."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Slowly, Sister climbed first one flight, then the second, until she found the apartment that had burned. In the growing light, it was difficult to say what had ignited in the blast, though the smell of smoke and burned wool was strong. And then she saw on the floor a man’s overcoat and the sodden cushions of a high-backed couch, and the black traces of a large burn across the waterlogged rug. In the kitchen, there were the charred remains of a pair of muslin curtains and an arc of soot along the oven wall. She ran her finger through it, only to confirm that it would be easily removed. What would be difficult to remove, she knew, was the terrible odor. The smell of wet cinders, doused peat, damp stone, and swollen wood. Fire, shipwreck, the turned earth of graveyards."
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"Sister St. Savior moved her finger up the page. “And now here’s a story of a suicide,” she continued. “On the same page. Over on Wards Island. A man being treated at the hospital over there, for madness. It seems he was doing well enough, but then he threw himself into the water and disappeared. At Hell’s Gate. It says the water covered him up at Hell’s Gate.” She clucked her tongue. “As if the Devil needed to put a fine point on his work.” She moved her arm once again. She might have been signing a blessing over the page. “And here’s another story, about a Wall Street man gone insane. Same day. Throwing bottles into the street, bellowing. Carted off to the hospital.” She leaned forward, squinting toward her finger on the page. “ ‘Where he demanded to see J. P. Morgan and Colonel Roosevelt.’ ”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The policemen nodded at the nun, and the shorter one took off his cap as he moved toward her. He, too, was singed about the cuffs. He had a heavy face and bad dentures, but there was compassion in the way he gestured with his short arms, toward the girl on the bed, toward the ceiling and the upstairs apartment, where the fire had been, a compassion that seemed to weigh down his limbs. Soft-hearted, Sister thought, one of us. The girl, he said, had come in from her shopping and found the door to her place blocked from the inside. She went to her neighbors, the man next door and the woman who lived here. They helped her push the door open and then the man lit a match to hold against the darkness. There was an explosion. Luckily, he, the policeman, was just at the corner and was able to put the fire out, while neighbors carried the three of them down here. Inside the apartment, in the bedroom, he had found a young man on the bed, dead. Asphyxiated. The girl’s husband."

You can run them over for me. We’ve got a Mass set for six tomorrow morning. Then the cemetery. The ground, praise God, isn’t frozen. It’ll all be finished before the new day’s begun.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"The nun lifted Annie’s hand from her hair—it was a mad, dramatic gesture that would lead to mad, dramatic speech—and placed it once again on her middle, where her thoughts should be. “It might be best,” Sister said, “if you don’t move tonight. I’ll speak to the lady of the house. We’ll get something arranged.”"
"These Short, Dark Days"	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/24/these-short-dark-days			"“What we must do,” she said at last, “is put one foot in front of the other.” It was her usual introductory phrase. “Have you had your dinner?” she said. The girl shook her head against the nun’s thigh. “Are there relations we can call for you?” Again she shook her head. “No one,” she whispered. “Just Jim and me.” Sister had the impulse to lift the girl’s shoulders a bit, to take the pressure of her weight off her own aching bladder, but resisted. She could endure it a little longer. “You’ll need a place to stay,” she said. “For tonight, anyway.”"
