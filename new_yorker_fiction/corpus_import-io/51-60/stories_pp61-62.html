After a couple of years in New York, she realized that she had to give people a little more information to stop them wondering, so once she’d mentioned Greenwich she would quickly add that she’d gone to “the high school,” meaning the public one. The first time she said this, you’d find her forthrightness refreshing—disarming, even, in the midst of so many pretenders. You’d be prompted, perhaps, to admit something about yourself—the fact that you were doing Jenny Craig, for instance, and had to sneak the packaged food into your office microwave when no one was paying attention. But then you’d overhear Christie making the same confession to someone else, and it would lose its charm. It was just Fact No. 2, which, added to Fact No. 1—her childhood in Greenwich—represented the sum total of what could be stated about Christie Thorn’s background, about her entire life before college and New York. Plus, you couldn’t help being suspicious of her motives in revealing Fact No. 2. If, at a party, a group of people were standing around, sharing a corner of the room, and someone made an opening bid—mentioning Hotchkiss or St. George’s, say—Christie would always pointedly interject, “Oh, I wouldn’t know. I went to public school. Greenwich High. That’s right—I was a good old suburban kid.” Of course, Christie and the person who had mentioned boarding school were doing the same thing—preëmptively defending themselves against attack—and yet you were tempted to give the Hotchkiss guy a free pass. With him, you could figure that his parents had divorced badly, or his mother was an alcoholic, or his brother had committed suicide (or perhaps it really had been an accidental overdose), or that in keeping with the family tradition Dad had gone crazy and now spent his days in slippers and a robe shooting intricate, archaic forms of pool. On account of one or more of these family problems, the young man felt insecure about himself as an individual, and so, in situations of social challenge, he mentioned boarding school a little too early, and a little unnaturally, to shore up his resolve. Still, whatever his problem, whatever the big bad family secret, it was just the slightly burned edge on a cake that everyone still wanted to eat. How bad could those family problems really be, you’d asked yourself more than once, if, at the same time, you had a house on the Vineyard? How bad—if you had the gray shingles, the weathered shutters, the slanting attic roof, the iron bedstead, the needlepoint pillows proclaiming, “A woman’s place is on the tennis court!,” the batterie de cuisine of lobster pots and potato mashers from the forties, and the octagonal kitchen window, through which you could glimpse the dunes and smell the salt air—could anything really be? Meanwhile, you’d assume that Christie had more to protect, that her history was more embarrassing, somehow: a chronological downsizing of suburban homes (all of them, albeit, technically still in Greenwich), a cheapness in things like bedding and glassware, or four people sharing one bathroom with a standup shower. And you wouldn’t be wrong. The real story was simple, of course, simple and unnecessarily sad. Christie’s father had gone into business for himself and had cash-flow problems. That was all. No one had murdered anyone; there wasn’t a whiff of incest or abuse, embezzlement or even tax fraud. Mr. Thorn had owed money his whole life, but he paid his bills more or less on time, and, when he died, his life-insurance policy would pay off the mortgage on the house. He was an honest man with a clean conscience. Yet Christie’s conscience was not clean, and seemed never to have been. In a typical scenario from her adolescence, her father would plan a nice vacation for the family, then wouldn’t have enough cash to cover it, Christie would throw a tantrum, and her mother, who spoiled her, would somehow find the money to appease her. Christie would go on the vacation, but she would go alone, with a similarly spoiled friend. She and the friend would go helling around Key West, say, or Miami Beach, feeling worse and worse and worse and laughing harder and harder. And then, and this was the kicker, Christie’s mother would pick them up at LaGuardia (the friend’s mother could never be bothered) and would want to know—would have been anxious about, primordially concerned about—whether they’d had a good time. On the way back from one of these vacations when she was sixteen or seventeen, Christie and her friend checked in late and were bumped up to first class. They were separated, and Christie was seated next to a distinguished-looking older man. He drank Scotches and read a golf magazine, and, when the flight was delayed, the two became partners in peevish complaint, the man turning to Christie to include her in his “Can you believe this?” glare. Eventually, he asked her where she was from, and when she said, “Greenwich,” he looked at her with a kind of absolute approval that she couldn’t recall ever having inspired before. After that, whenever a flight of hers was delayed she’d shake her head and say, “Time to spare, go by air,” as the Scotch-drinking man had, and when she met people she liked to make sure that they knew where she was from. After college, after a prolonged phase of running around New York while drifting through a series of support jobs at big firms, and after she had slept with, I think, either fifty-five or sixty-five men, Christie found someone to marry. We spent a lot of time speculating as to who would be invited to the wedding (only a strange, angry girl named Mary McLean, who had made some Faustian bargain with Christie long before any of us met her, considered herself one of Christie’s real friends), but in the end everyone was invited—and to the Pierre, no less. Throughout the evening, Christie wore a look of incurable dissatisfaction. Her face was gaudily made up, as if for a school play or an ice-skating competition. At the reception, her parents seemed frightened. It was as if they had been instructed to keep their mouths shut at all costs. A guest would shake Mrs. Thorn’s hand in the receiving line and say, “Hi, I’m Jen Ryan. Christie and I were roommates at Trinity?” and Mrs. Thorn would nod, grimfaced, and say—literally—nothing. The groom’s name was Thomas Bruewald, and he was gawky and tall, with an oversized head and a unibrow. His parents were never identified. Apparently they were foreign. He had grown up half over here and half over there—in Bavaria, was it? Or Croatia? At any rate, it wasn’t Umbria or Aix or anywhere worth trying to lock in an invitation for. Bruewald had gone to one of those Euro institutes with the word “polytechnical” in the name. The champagne at the reception was a little too good, and some people had more than their fill and, by the end of the night, were making rude remarks. One guy said that Christie’s parents must have taken out a second mortgage to pay for the wedding. “Didn’t know you could get a second mortgage on a trailer,” somebody else said. And then, of course, you got “Hey, wait a minute! There are no trailers”—the crowd in unison—“in Greenwich, Connecticut!” But nobody said that the groom was funny-looking. You could pick on Christie for trying too hard, you could note the moment when Mr. Thorn took off his tuxedo jacket and started doing body shots with the bridesmaids, but you didn’t pick on the groom’s looks. You just didn’t go there. Christie herself was quite pretty. She had large, unflawed features and blond hair that was only a shade or two lighter than her natural color. She was also thin. And, in an age when Manhattan had been overrun by the kind of chain stores you’d find at a suburban mall, these attributes had kept her in dates for a decade and the word “beautiful” had been lobbed over her head with surprising—to some of us, disturbing—frequency. The groom had some kind of science-related job—engineering or drug research—that required a reverse commute to New Jersey. And, once the wedding was over, once the gift had been ordered (they had registered for everything but the kitchen sink, in anticipation, evidently, of dinners for sixteen at which oysters would be served and finger bowls required), once the thank-you note from Christie—Christie Bruewald now—had arrived, it seemed that only the sparsest smattering of social interactions was indicated, coffee or a drink twice a year. There was even some thought that the newlyweds would move out of the city. Christie had always talked non-stop about children (little trophies, one presumed, to fill up that bottomless pit of dissatisfaction), and the suburbs had been mentioned more than once. Christie’s new thing, at our biannual meetings, was to brag about her visits to Thomas’s family in Europe. It was mystifying—one would not have thought an “in” in the former East Germany particularly brag-worthy, and, in any case, everyone at the wedding had seen how cowed the guy was, how classic the trade they had made. Did she think we didn’t see her boasts for what they were? She started to slip into conversation the fact that Thomas’s uncle had a title, or had had one—she was vague on the details—and she mentioned that there was a castle in the family. Her Christmas card (sent yearly to all of us, even though we had not sent one to her in years) introduced the Bruewald family crest. It was all so ludicrous and pathetic, really, when they were living in a studio in a high-rise on York Avenue. “So why do you even see her?” my husband would ask. (I was married now, too.) “If she’s so awful, why don’t you dump her? Just don’t call back.” Like most men, he had no patience with these pseudo-friendships between women that drag on for years. The question bothered me, and in my head I came up with three reasons that I continued to see Christie Bruewald, née Thorn, at six-month intervals. First, I enjoyed taking note of her pretensions. I enjoyed seeing how far she would go. In a way, I had exulted in the family-crest Christmas card. I had put it up on the refrigerator and shown it to everyone who came over. I was dying, now, to see what would follow. When I met her for coffee, I went prepared with a mental tape recorder to catch her appalling lapses in taste—not so much for myself as to pass on to everyone else. Second, there were, I have to admit, sparks of humanity in Christie’s pretensions, and in her desires, that I felt were missing in the rest of my life. She had coveted a huge diamond ring. She had hoped to land a guy with money. She had wanted her wedding to be an extravaganza, a day she’d remember for the rest of her life. She wasn’t “over it.” She wasn’t over anything. She knew what she wanted, and she wanted the kinds of things that the marketers of luxury goods describe as “the best”—Jacuzzis, chandeliers, access to the tropics in the middle of winter. Third, and finally, what got me, I suppose, were the indications of humanity in Christie’s life that had nothing to do with her pretensions. The family crest on the Christmas card had been embossed onto a picture of the Bruewalds and their new baby in matching red-and-green velvet outfits. The little girl looked exactly like Thomas—an odd-featured brown-haired old man. She wouldn’t have the advantage of Christie’s looks, and, for someone as entranced by the superficial as Christie was, that must have been hard to take. You could say that I felt sorry for her. Still, despite my three reasons, a year or so after my own wedding I went through a period when I felt it was important to burn the fat from my life. Christie had begun to represent all that was wrong with New York—which, as usual, meant what I was tired of in myself. I wrote “Seeing people like Christie Thorn” on a list of things that were a waste of time, and when she called and left a message to start the back-and-forth that would culminate in our having lunch a few weeks later, I didn’t call back. Perhaps I ended it then simply because the interesting part appeared to be over. Though my own life still seemed to me a fount of infinite promise, hers felt blandly curtailed. I realized that there was a part of me that had almost wanted her to make it, on her own terms, whatever they might be. The sad thing about Christie’s wedding was that it hadn’t been outrageous at all; it had been just another overpriced New York wedding spearheaded by a bride with too much makeup on. I found it all too easy to imagine how her story would continue, how, inevitably, it would end. I lived with that story, kept the thread going in my mind, and added to it from time to time, when some event in my own life recalled Christie’s unhappy mixture of envy and drive, of self-promotion and apology. My version (wholly fictional) went something like this: Having married for money, Christie quickly discovers that she hasn’t married for enough. Realizing her mistake only deepens the dissatisfaction she feels with her life, and, in order to convince herself that things can still change, she has an innocuous little affair in the first six months of her marriage. The second affair, a year later, is not so innocuous. Thomas is doing as well as he ever has, but this is New York, and after their second child the Bruewalds are unable to afford a big enough apartment in the city and they make the move to the suburbs. (For Christie, Brooklyn, or a bohemian setup with the baby in the living room, has never been an option.) They buy a starter house in one of the less well-known towns of Westchester. They socialize a lot and their favorite friends are people like themselves, but who make a little less than they do, and are jealous of them for some other reason as well—Christie’s having lost the weight after her pregnancies, say. The kids are the usual product of a marriage like the Bruewalds’. They suffer from Christie’s frustrated ambition and their father’s subservience to it, and they end up angry and self-hating beneath a surface of entitlement. But the European influence helps to normalize them somewhat, and at least they know how to ski. When the children are grown and out of the house, Christie starts spending most of her time down at the time-share in Cancún, befriending other “party people,” whose spouses turn a blind eye. But she and Thomas never divorce because she’s afraid to be alone. That would be about the size of it. It would end in a sorry, grasping old age, marked by an incivility to service people (flight attendants, doctors’ secretaries) and a dye job that wasn’t what it used to be. It was what she deserved, wasn’t it? There is order in things, and people who spend a hundred grand on a wedding they can’t afford simply not to lose face should pay in some way. Who was she kidding? It will be clear from my iteration of Christie’s excesses that, as a couple, my husband and I have always prided ourselves on living within our means. When the time comes for us to move into a bigger apartment, we understand that staying in the city will mean living at the back of a building, in interior rooms that open onto shaftways. So it’s only for kicks, just to see what we’re missing, that we ask our broker to show us something fancy. We go prepared to look, to smile wistfully, and to depart, understanding that by any reasonable standards we have more than enough, and by any other standards we simply don’t measure ourselves. When, high up in Carnegie Hill, on our way into one of those hushed old buildings that face the Park, our two-year-old daughter falls in love with the doorman, we take it, laughing, with endless hope for the future, as a sign that the girl knows quality when she sees it. “You can see him on the way out,” we promise. “He’ll still be there.” Yet, when we fall in love with the apartment itself, we cannot take it as a sign of anything at all. It is smaller by a room than the others we’ve looked at; and costs more by . . . oh, about a hundred grand. Where are our wistful smiles now? Where is our comfort in reasonable standards? It is clear that we—and only we—are capable of fully appreciating the charm of this place. Who but we would actually enjoy the fact that the stove and the refrigerator appear, like the building, to be prewar? Who but we would keep the sixties-style wallpaper in the maid’s room? (The ghost of Christie Thorn shakes her head in annoyance at the broker: “Total gut job in the kitchen!” “No closet space!” “No wet bar!”) And then there is our daughter and the doorman, who is pretending to play hide-and-seek with her, while we stand wordless in the marble lobby, looking out at the green of the Park, doing sums in our head, reconsidering decisions of the past, decisions that might have netted us this apartment, pure and simple. Because now nothing else will do. The apartment is at the breaking point of our price range, and though on paper we can swing it, our broker calls that night with bad news: he’s shopped us to the board, and they are reluctant to consider anyone whose liquid assets are as low as ours. That fast, it’s over. We have been slotted into position. We know—and can laugh bitterly at the notion that this knowledge, in other circumstances, is supposed to be comforting—exactly where we are. A week after the bad news, I walk by the building, daughterless this time. A man emerges, then two schoolgirls in uniform. I put my sunglasses on to hide the fact that I am staring in an ugly, covetous way. How tortured and unpleasant I must look compared with the woman my age who comes out next, well dressed, well coiffed, followed by two children, a girl and a boy, who are followed in turn by two nannies. For an incredible moment, I mistake the woman for an older, more sophisticated Christie Thorn. Out of habit I am pretending not to see even this twin of hers (the way you ignore a man in a bar who resembles your ex-boyfriend), when the doorman’s greeting rings out—yes, as if in a dream—“Mrs. Bruewald.” “Hi, Lester.” He asks how long she will be, and the woman says, “Oh, an hour or two. We’re just going to go to the Park and do some shopping before Daddy gets home.” In a vile moment of Darwinian survival, I paste a smile on my face, and I call out, “Christie?” We went to an Italian restaurant on Madison. Kids and nannies were dispatched to the Park. It was an off hour, three or four o’clock, and I remember I almost hated to dirty one of the white linen tablecloths, which were already set for dinner. We started with cappuccinos, then moved on to glasses of the house white. Later, when we got hungry, the waiter brought antipasto and some bread, and to wash it down I had another glass of white wine and Christie switched to red. I was longing for a cigarette, and eventually I asked her, “Do you still smoke?” “My God, I’m dying for one,” she said, and took a pack out of her purse. We each smoked two. I should explain that it was one of those surreally springlike days at the tail end of winter, the kind of afternoon when you flirt with the mailman, the coffee-cart man, and the busboy, when you long for a new pair of open-toed sandals and a good excuse to sit in a café all afternoon, ignoring your responsibilities and getting drunk. Well, we had one. There was catching up to be done—husbands, children, careers, in a nutshell. From the beginning, I was drinking rather fast. All the information-sharing, I realized, was making me uneasy. I, who used to rattle off insouciantly all the good things that had happened to me, was guarded now. I had something to protect, it seemed. I held back, forming half-truths for every potential question Christie might pose—asking myself, “Will I tell her about that or not? Will I act as if everything’s fine or will I level with her?”—while she grew expansive with me, as she now could. The family crest was not a joke; it was not a sham. In some little town in the former East Germany, the Bruewalds were evidently a big deal. “All the money was tied up in this castle in Saxony—this huge, horrible, dark, awful house—and, the minute Onkel Guenther died, Thomas and I looked at each other and we were like, ‘We’re selling!’ It was like, before he died we couldn’t mention it, and the minute we got the news we never looked back. It was a done deal.” They had sold the Schloss, auctioned the furniture, and inherited the lot, except, of course, for what was in trust for Hildie and Axel. (It had occurred to me that although Hildie still resembled her father, her appearance would be seen, later in life, as distinguishing; people would seek ownership of those peculiar looks, the way they would those of a rock star’s eccentric-looking daughter. Only outsiders would make the obvious comments; insiders would know better.) In addition to the apartment on Fifth Avenue, the Bruewalds now owned a ski lodge in the Arlberg, a country house in New Jersey, and a mansion in Solln, which Christie described as “the Greenwich of Munich.” The sheer weight of the information had made me dizzy, but when she mentioned Greenwich I sat up and did her the one courtesy I could. I fed her the line. “That must be nice,” I said. “It must feel like home.” She drained her glass of wine, though she had already drained it once, and then she put it down and unexpectedly met my eye. She said, “You know, when we got the money I went out and got myself a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar-an-hour shrink. I used to think I was a horrible person.” She wasn’t a horrible person, the shrink had told her; in fact, there was nothing wrong with her at all. We split a third glass of wine and then a fourth, making the waiter laugh. During the fourth, I told her why I had been loitering outside her building—not hoping to get something out of it, just wanting to ante up with something real of my own. Christie laughed, the way you laugh at something you don’t quite believe, and at first I interpreted her incredulity as an attack—that’s how defensive I felt. “Oh, for Christ’s sake!” she said. “You’ve got to be kidding!” I stared stonily at the table, the way I do when I’m both drunk and mortally offended. “No, no—listen. Thomas is on the board, and they owe him a big favor. This is no problem, no problem at all. Don’t believe what they say about the liquid assets. It’s just a way of keeping people out. Anyway,” she said, “I’ll tell them about your Mayflower ancestor.” “I told you about our Mayflower ancestor?” I said. “Of course you did!” She smiled. “The first time we met.” There was nothing I could do but turn red and finish the wine. Christie went to the bathroom, and I sat there flipping a matchbook over and over in my hand. I had an anticipatory feeling, as if I were waiting for a date to return, as if we might be planning to go back to her deluxe pad and make out on her and Thomas’s king-size bed. People had always said that Christie had a great body, and that’s the kind of body it was—firm, relentlessly fit, and offered up as a commodity for others to comment on. In the early nineties, she had been an aerobics queen, logging two, three hours a day at the gym; now, of course, she was into yoga and Pilates, but, “to tell you the truth,” she’d confessed earlier in the afternoon, “I kind of miss the screaming and the jumping up and down.” We had moved to the city at the same time—ten years ago now—and sitting there, playing with the matchbook, I tried to get a handle on what those ten years had amounted to. We had been single. Now we were married women with children. But, despite the italics in my head, I couldn’t seem to take it any further than that. My thoughts drifted to the apartment, trying again, I suppose, to notch the progress we had each made. If my husband and I got the place, we’d be cash-poor for a few years. With both of us working, we could bring in x amount per year, put y aside, and contribute z to our 401(k)s. But, even considering promotions and raises, there was a limit to x. X was fixed, and there was only t—time—to increase it. But time ate up your life. You could say, “In ten years,” “In twenty years.” But the problem was that then whatever it was would be in ten years, or in twenty years. A decade, two decades of your life would have gone by before you attained it. The fixity of x was the most bittersweet thing I had thought of in ages. Of course, it was comparing myself with Christie that had brought on all these thoughts. When she came out of the ladies’ room, looking as happy and drunk as I had felt a minute before, her innocence struck me like a storm. And I realized that what separated us, and perhaps had always separated us, was the understanding that I had only just reached: in life you can only get so far. I walked home with the good news for my husband and daughter. It seemed that Christie and I were going to be friends again, or friends after all, I should say. My husband would be dubious, to say the least. “The same Christie Thorn you told me you would never have coffee with again?” Nor would he like the idea of her getting us past the board; it would take a week to make him understand what had changed in the course of an afternoon and why it wasn’t the case that we were simply using her. Then again, I deserved a dose of his skepticism. I had carried on about her—had laughed in my best moments, but from time to time had been derisive, too, and even indignant. I asked myself, now, how I truly felt about all her pretensions. I went through them one by one—the wedding, the Christmas card, then little things, little remarks from her single days, her obsession with the “it” handbag every year, for instance. I came to the conclusion that none of it was worth getting worked up about. None of it was profound. As the shrink had evidently made clear, none of it had anything to do with Christie herself. On the contrary, I told myself, it was your problem. ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

I went to make my appraisal of the contents of the house on an overcast morning in spring. The sky was a threatful gray, yet the willows blazed in tender bud, and drifts of wild-apple blossoms floated in the cavern pines. I kept the windows slightly open as I drove the back roads to the Tatro house, and breathed in the watery air. The Tatros had always been too cheap to keep up their road, and the final quarter mile was partly washed out, the gnarled bedrock exposed. Overgrown swamps and ponds lapped close to either side. As I bounced along, the frogs quieted momentarily, so that I seemed to be continuously pushing against a wall of sound. Once I stopped, the frogs began trilling again. Making my way up the flagstone walkway to where the Tatros' grandniece waited, I stopped a moment, caught in the vehemence. Spring in New Hampshire can be disorienting—virginal and loudly sexual all at once. The Tatro house was not grand anymore. The original nineteenth-century homestead had been renovated and enlarged so many times that its style was obscured. Here a cornice, there a ledge. The building was now a great clapboard mishmash, with aluminum-clad storm windows bolted over the old rippled glass and a screen porch tacked darkly across its front. The siding was painted the brown-red color of old blood. The over-all appearance of the house was ramshackle and sad, but the woman who greeted me was cheerful enough, and the interior was comfortable, though dim. We began my first, casual viewing. The rooms were filled with an odor I have grown used to in my work. It is an indefinable scent, really, made up of mothballs and citrus oil, of dust and cracked leather. The smell of old things. I noted that an inordinate number of closets seemed to have been added to the house during some period of expansion, even on the ground floor. The niece, whose name was Sarah, was a pleasant, square-jawed woman, with light-brown hair and blue eyes. She was in her mid-thirties, perhaps ten years younger than I am, and the sort of woman who volunteers to supervise recess or construct grade-school art projects. I knew the type. I had attempted to be the type. So had my mother. But our fascination with the stuff of life, or, more precisely, with the afterlife of stuff, had always set us apart. Mother had started the business, and we had run it jointly now for nearly two decades. We are fair, discreet, honest, and knowledgeable. We are well known in our part of New Hampshire, and well respected, I think. There is a certain advantage to our gender. More often than not, it is the women of the family who get stuck dealing with the physical estate, the possessions, and we are also women. We understand what it is like to face a mountain of petty decisions when in grief. As I sat down with Sarah, to formalize things over a cup of coffee, I felt the comfortable and immediate sense of solidarity that I often feel with other women at times like this—there is sympathy, of course, but also some relief. Finally, to get on with things! There is even some excitement at the idea of the task ahead. Cleaning out a house can numb you to the bone, but there are always discoveries along the way. Some are valuable—an original Shaker table under a coat of milk paint, a fabulous porcelain or saccharine but valuable old Hummels amid chipped salt-and-pepper shakers. Once, an old bucket forgotten in a pantry corner turned out to be a hand-painted Leder, worth thousands. First editions turn up, too: a signed Mark Twain, a Wharton, maybe a pristine Salinger—you never know what will surface from even the most unpromising pile. And then some discoveries are revelatory—diaries, packets of love letters, a case of antique pornography featuring trained ponies, certificates listing surprising causes of death or unknown births. The contents of a house can trigger all sorts of revisions to a family history. Behind my eagerness to take on the Tatro estate, there was also a thread of connection that reached back several generations. My mother and I specialize in Native American antiquities. In “The History of Stiles and Stokes,” a book published on subscription by our local historical society, there is an entire chapter devoted to the Tatro family, and within that chapter a paragraph about the great-grandfather of the most recently deceased Tatro. Jewett Parker Tatro had been an Indian agent on the Ojibwa reservation in North Dakota, where my own grandmother was born and where she lived until the age of six, at which time she was taken East and enrolled at the Carlisle Indian School, in Pennsylvania. There she had learned to sew intricately, to add and subtract, to do laundry, to scrub a floor clean, to read, write, and recite Bible passages, Shakespeare sonnets, Keats odes, and the Declaration of Independence. The Carlisle school was also where she fell in love. My grandmother had stayed in the East with the young teacher she married shortly after graduating, though she returned for visits and bore my mother on her own allotment land. But we have never really been Easterners. The connection between Tatro and the reservation was of interest to us because it wasn't uncommon for Indian agents back then to amass extensive collections of artifacts, and of course we had always wondered whether the Tatro house held such a trove. Although we'd had little indication while the last two Tatro brothers were alive (they died within two months of each other), and at first I saw nothing that would lead me to think that those closets held anything more exotic than magazines and clothing and phonograph records, there had been rumors. And to our knowledge a large-scale Tatro collection had never been donated to any local, state, or college museum. There were those many closets and the thick walls of the downstairs rooms. Also, there was the Tatros' character—there was certainly that—to consider. They were sharp, they were shrewd, they were flinty, calm cheaters and secret hoarders. They haunted tag sales. Bought food in bulk. Hitchhiked when gas was expensive, though they were not poor. Saved the rubber bands off broccoli and bananas, when they bought such luxuries. They boiled the sap from their trees and stole the corn from their neighbors' fields. They picked fiddleheads, tore fruit off stunted trees, shot and roasted raccoons. Each fall they bought and salted down a pig, devouring it from snout to hock over the course of a year. To my mind, the Tatros were the sort of cheap old Yankee bachelors who would keep a valuable collection of artifacts just because it had never occurred to them to part with anything. They would simply have hung on to their stuff—moldering, mothballed, packed away with cedar blocks—until Judgment Day. Curiously, perhaps, the house I live in with my mother is not cluttered. It's not that our vocation has made us snobbish. Rather, it is the constant reminder of our own mortality that reins us in. To strive to own anything of extraordinary value generally strikes us as absurd, given our biodegradability. Still, there are a few objects we've found irresistible. Their nature probably reveals that we are more captive to our background than we admit: a lustrous double-throated Maria Martinez wedding vase; an Ojibwa cradleboard, with a wrap of intricately beaded velvet; three very fine Navajo rugs; a bandolier bag that was probably carried by the last Ojibwa war leader, Bugonageshig himself; a few seed pots; several shaved-quill boxes; and some heavy old turquoise that must be continually polished. Yes, we'd like to leave our path to Heaven clear, to travel a spare, true road. Yet we're human enough. Sarah Tatro did not intend to let the house and its contents trap her. Over the cup of coffee—one of those thick diner-style white mugs, surely swiped from a local café by one of the uncles—she told me that she was anxious to clear the place out and put it on the market. I found her forthrightness appealing and, at the same time, the idea that the Tatro house would pass from Tatro ownership after nearly two centuries infected me with a faint melancholy. It is unusual for one place to remain so long in the same family—I was, surprisingly, tempted to try to dissuade her from breaking with the past and carrying on with, of all things, her own life. I controlled myself. I took out my notebook and began to make a rough list of the contents of the house. Later, I would be joined by two assistants, but I prefer to work alone at first, as does my mother. I like to get a feel for the things in a house, a sense of the outlook of the person who, though safely in the next world, still lingers in the arrangement and treatment of his goods. I like to make peace with the dead. I asked Sarah if her great-uncle had had any particular interest or collection that might require special handling or appraisal. “Oh, I don't know, there's just so much of everything.” She waved her hands. “So many old sets of dishes. And he owned a number of guns. Some of those are old. And then the closets on the ground floor go way back behind the walls. They're stuffed. So, really, it's anybody's guess.” I was on my own, and soon I was immersed in the pleasures of my job. The sorrows of strangers are part of my business, and, were I to examine my motives for choosing this line of work, I might find that from their losses I extract some bit of comfort—as though my constant proximity to death protected me and those I love. The furniture in the first two rooms on the ground floor was in adequate repair and quite good, though there were no “finds.” Predictably, the Tatros hadn't been bibliophiles, nor was there much in the way of decorative touches—lamps, vases, figurines. Yet the walls were hung with six nice paintings by local artists, and there was one oil sketch, a sort of pre-painting drawing, by Maxfield Parrish. That discovery alone would have made my day at any other time. In this case, it also indicated the Tatro tendency to hold on to things, as Parrish was well known and the work could easily have been sold. I tried not to get my hopes up, but when I opened the door to the first closet my fingers were clumsy with excitement. Quickly, I went through what I could see. The usual boxes of magazines. Piles of curtains and old and faded linen. A great many boots of all styles, reaching back for decades. Mothballed coats made of everything from wool to skunk fur. The closet went on and on, but soon enough I decided to leave it to my assistants. The next closet was stuffed with records. Mostly 78 r.p.m., swing or big band. I was beginning to worry that the rumors were just that, when, upon embarking on a wide bank of shelves built into a wall, I found the first indication of, it seems curious to say, life. Some estates come to life and others don't. Some holdings have little personality, others much. There is a moment I think of still, one I nearly missed. Years ago, I opened a small wooden chest containing what appeared to be handkerchiefs wrapped in tissue paper, just handkerchiefs, bearing the owner's initials: L.M.B. I was about to empty the box and scatter its contents among the linens, when I noticed a label. Pinned to each cotton, lawn, lace-trimmed, or embroidered handkerchief, I realized, was a carefully cut label with a date inked in ladylike script. A name, or names, were written. And occasions: “Teddy's Christening.” “Venetta and John Howard's Wedding.” “Teddy's Funeral.” “Brother Adamantine's Wake.” “First Opera, 'La Traviata.' ” “Broken Arm.” And far down at the bottom, perhaps the handkerchief that started the collection, a child's small square of fabric clumsily labelled “My Mother's Funeral.” I remember sitting with the handkerchiefs of L.M.B. as the rest of the work of pricing and sorting swirled around me. Here was a box containing a woman's lifetime of tears. I passed through several stages of emotion. The first was elation at the novelty of such an idea, and I felt the urge to show the box to my assistants. Next, I was swept through with irritation. I almost never think of non-Indians as “white”; after all, my own skin is pale. But I experienced a sudden jolt of prejudice that surprised me. Just like a white lady—so stingy with her tears she kept them, I thought. Then I recovered myself and sat a little longer, holding the box, which was very light, old varnished pine, and turning over one handkerchief after another. “Theodor's Precious Birth.” “Aunt Lilac's Deathbed Supper.” What was a deathbed supper? “Cousin Franklin's Wedding to Mildred Vost.” More funerals. The other workers left to tackle the next room, and it was then, sitting with L.M.B.'s sorrows and joys, that my own eyes filled with tears. There weren't many. I am not the crying sort anymore. But when I did feel that swell of sadness I reached immediately for one of the handkerchiefs, dabbed my eyes, and added my own tears to the box. Then I closed the box. I knew that what had happened was exactly right. “Tears Shed for L.M.B.,” I might have written on a scrap of paper. I'd have to buy the box myself now, but that seemed the proper close to the collection. I'd heard that the owner had become a ferocious bore in her old age, critical, churchy, and prone to making complaint calls to the parents of young boys who cut across her front lawn or spoiled her tulips. But that's what I mean by coming to life. The estate of John Jewett Tatro came into a similar focus when I made the acquaintance of a doll with a face of fawnskin and eyes of jet. I knew that the doll was something special the moment I put my hands on it. It was wrapped in faded red trade cloth and placed inside a shoebox. The shoebox had been mistakenly stored on a shelf of shoes, and when I opened it I caught an unmissable whiff of smoked hide—a smell that could only have accumulated, molecule by molecule, over the course of years. As I removed the doll from its wrapping, the fugitive taste of smoke vanished and there was the doll herself, exquisite. The perfectly cured hide that was her skin had somehow retained its softness, though from the faintly smudged darknesses on her arms and skirt I saw that she had been loved as a toy. Her red quill lips were stitched into a calm, amused smile, and her bead eyes were set at a lively angle. Her coarse black hair had been plucked from a horse's mane and divided into braids. Her dress was also made of tanned hide, decorated with bits of shell and the old antique beads called “greasy yellow” and “ruby-red whiteheart” and “German blue.” Her waist was belted with a woven sash. Attached to it, she wore a scabbard that secured a tiny skinning knife. Her moccasins were sewn with flowers, and a ring of trade silver made a bracelet on her arm. From her pierced fawnskin ears dangled miniature earbobs, hawk's bells so unusually small that they could have hung from the throats of warblers. She carried a thimble-size basket woven so cleverly that I laughed in pleasure. I brought the doll out at once, and showed her to Sarah. “Oh, there she is!” She took the doll from its wrapping and handled it with familiar tenderness, smoothing the coarse hair down and caressing the slender horsehair brows embroidered above the glittering eyes. “My uncles used to let me play with her if I was very good.” “She's very good, you know. Valuable, I mean. We should have a museum curator look at her.” “Yeah?” Sarah was surprised, but not particularly pleased. I think she felt the same way I did about the doll. It was personal—the delight of owning the doll had nothing to do with its worth. “Were there other things—American Indian, I mean—of that era?” I asked. “Did your uncles keep them all together somewhere? In a cabinet? Trunks?” “Oh, God, yes, I'd forgotten all about it. One of the Tatros way back lived with the Indians,” she said. “There was a lot of old beadwork and stuff. Come on upstairs, I'll show you.” On the way up the stairs, I tried to breathe slowly. There was an attic room, of course—a long, unfinished tar-papered hall lined with simple board shelves and stuffed with old suitcases. Most of the artifacts were kept in these suitcases, Sarah told me. There were also some larger things, wrapped in old bedspreads and horse blankets. We unveiled these at once—a cradleboard not as good as mine, large birch-bark winnowing baskets, a beadworked footstool, a drum. The suitcases held some precious examples of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century bead-and-cloth appliqué work. There were moccasins, leggings, beaded ceremonial breech clouts, a vest, and two bandolier bags (in extraordinary condition, worth a great deal). There were also a number of lesser items—small purses of the sort once sold to tourists, a band for a headdress from which all the feathers had been removed, tobacco pouches, woven carrying straps and reed mats. We laid things out, unwrapped, on the tops of suitcases, draped off the edges of drawers and shelves, but stopped eventually. The collection went on and on. “Congratulations,” I said, and there must have been some degree of feeling in my voice. Sarah Tatro looked startled. “Congratulations for what?” “You can probably retire,” I said. “Or at least take a long vacation. No more early-morning wakeup calls.” “You think all this is valuable?” “Very.” Sarah dropped to a trunk and put her head in her hands. “You mean they were sitting on this all along?” I said nothing, and after a time she shook her head and laughed shortly, without humor. “They were so cheap they ate oatmeal for dinner. And they spread Crisco on their bread instead of butter. The taxes on this place had gone sky-high, of course, and they wanted to keep it. So they lived on nothing. But in the end . . .” Her voice lifted. “I have to say I think they enjoyed their stinginess.” And then she laughed with more ease. “They probably even enjoyed what they had here. You can see they went through these things. Checked them for mildew or bugs, I guess, rewrapped them. Set mousetraps. Look.” She showed me the date on a newspaper that had been used to cushion a little sweet-grass basket. “Last year's.” “That's fortunate,” I said. “The acid in the newspaper could have ruined that basket.” I moved closer to look at the little coiled and sewn basket, and that is when I stepped near the drum. I'm not a sentimental person. How could I be? I have seen the most intimate objects proceed to other hands, indifferent to the love once bestowed on them. Some people believe that things absorb their owners' essence. I stay clear of that. And yet when I stepped near the drum I swear it sounded. One deep, low, resonant note. I stopped dead, staring at the drum. I heard it, I know I heard it, and yet Sarah Tatro did not. “I'm getting out of here,” she said. “Too dusty. I'll be back later on this afternoon. I've got some errands in town.” And so I was left with Tatro's loot. I continued to stare at the drum, or what I could see, since it was mostly swaddled in a faded quilt. I'm not subject to imaginative fits, and I don't just hear things. There had to be an explanation. Something shifting to strike the skin. A change in air pressure. The quilt wasn't anything special, a simple collection of squares, machine-stitched and yarn-tied. I went over to the drum and pulled the fabric entirely away. The light in the attic came from two bare bulbs with pull chains, which cast harsh shadows. The head of the drum glared out, huge, three feet across at least. The moose that was skinned to make it must have been a giant. Yet there was something delicate about the drum, for it was intricately decorated, with a beaded belt and skirt, hung with tassels of pulled red yarn and sewn tightly all around with small tin cones, or tinklers. Four broad tabs were spaced equally around the top. Into their indigo tongues, four crosses were set, woven with brass beads. On the face of the drum, at the very center, a small bird was painted, in lighter blue. That was all. But the bird detail, the red flowered skirts, the tinklers, combined with the size of the drum, gave it an unusual sense of both power and sweetness. I drew a folding chair close, sat, and jotted down the details. My hand dragged across the page. This was the sort of find that should have thrilled me, but I was uneasy, anxious. I looked around. I set my hand on the drum and then I felt, pulling through me like a nerve, a clear conviction. It was visceral. Not a thought but an instinct. I covered the drum again and went out to make sure that Sarah had gone. When I saw that the garage was empty and I was alone, I propped open the back door and went straight to the attic. I bundled the quilt more tightly around the drum, and then I carried it out of the house, slid it into the trunk of my car, and hid it by pulling down the theft-deterring blind I always use when parking at big auctions. I worked the rest of the afternoon without thinking about what I'd done. When my thoughts flickered toward the drum, I veered away from any further examination. What I'd just done, or was about to do, was probably a felony and could ruin our business. The ease with which I had done it bewildered me. For a person who had not stolen so much as a candy bar all her life to walk coolly out of a client's house with such a valuable object might signal insanity. The beginning of a nervous breakdown. But I didn't feel that way. I felt quite lucid. And I wondered whether others who committed irrational and criminal acts felt this calm acceptance of a previously unknown part of themselves. Dusk was forming, blue and cold, by the time I arrived home. I left the drum in the car, wrapped in the quilt, underneath its stretched plastic curtain. I didn't want it in the house yet. I had to think—not about whether what I'd done was right. By then I had decided that I wouldn't have done it unless it was, on some level, right. And yet the explanation of this rightness swirled beyond my reach. My real concerns were whether I could keep the drum hidden and whether I'd get caught. I was pretty sure that Sarah Tatro hadn't noticed the drum; in fact, she'd seemed indifferent to all her uncle's objects, save the doll she had played with as a child. I was also fairly certain that she was the only person who would have any knowledge of her uncle's collection. And even she had forgotten that it existed. I'd had to take the drum that afternoon, if I was to take it at all. I knew that, once I had catalogued the objects and had them appraised, the drum would have priced itself out of the reach of all but the wealthiest collectors, or a museum. Yet I didn't want the drum. What would I do with such a thing? Where would I keep it? No, I hadn't taken the drum for myself. I reassured myself of this as I sat down to dinner with my mother. “You have an odd look on your face,” she said. “So, how was it?” I took the salad bowl from her hands and began forking leaves onto my plate. “Well, it was all there,” I told her. “Oh!” She put her fork down. I'd taken a mouthful of spinach, but suddenly I felt too tired to even chew. I slumped down in my chair. Then I threw my head back, stretched my arms. “I've been crouched over the notebook all afternoon. It's a real haul. Old—I mean old old—Tatro walked away with everything. Dolls, beadwork, cradleboards. You name it.” “So he got away with the good stuff. He had an eye.” We sat there with our food between us. My mother's hair, sleek and pulled back in a knot, was very white. She bore me late in age, when she had given up on getting pregnant. I was a gift. It's nice to be told, all your life, that you are a gift to someone. We were very happy right then, although I don't know exactly why. Perhaps it was just because our secret expectations had been met. “There was a drum,” I said to her. She pushed her plate away and leaned toward me, her elbows on the table. Her eyes were narrow and slightly upturned at the corners. The irises, dark brown, had the milky-blue ring of age, but her gaze was still sharp. She was waiting for me to describe the drum. “One of the big drums,” I said. Her fingers flickered on the table. “Was it dressed?” “What?” “Decorated.” “Yes.” “How?” I told her about the crosses. “Not crosses, not Christian. Those are stars. Was it painted?” “There was a bird. A little blue bird.” She closed her eyes, pressed two fingers to the space between her eyebrows. I watched her carefully, because she does this when she is trying to form a thought. Finally, she spoke. She talked a long time, and I can only sum up what she said: The drum is the universe. The people who take their place at each side represent the spirits who sit at the four directions. A painted drum, especially, is considered a living thing and must be fed as the spirits are fed—with tobacco and a glass of water set nearby, sometimes a plate of food. A drum is never to be placed on the ground, or left alone, and it is always to be covered with a blanket or quilt. Drums are known to cure and known to kill. They become one with their keeper. They are made for serious reasons by people who dream the details of their construction. No two are alike, but every drum is related to every other drum. They speak to one another and they give their songs to humans. I should be careful around the drum, she said. She was bothered by its presence in the collection. “It's more alive than a set of human bones,'' she finished. After she went to bed, I cleared off a low table in the corner of my bedroom and then I brought the drum inside and balanced it carefully on the table. I shoved two chairs up against each side. Whenever I touched the drum, even to set it down, it made a sound. A high, hollow note. Or a low, uncertain tone, like a question. A slight tap on its edge set up reverberations. It was exquisitely sensitive for so powerful an instrument, and I wondered what it sounded like when struck with force, by many and in unison. I turned off the light and got into bed. I leave my windows open just a crack at night, even in winter. The darkness seethed with spring music, and from time to time, deep in the woods, a barred owl screamed like a woman in pain. I thought I might have dreams—as pragmatic as I consider myself, it had been a long, strange day. The realization that I'd stolen the drum outright surfaced and sank in my consciousness. No matter how justified by history I felt, I promised myself that I would not evade my guilt or rationalize my conduct. Which was not the same as even considering that I might do the proper thing and return the drum to Sarah Tatro. All I have is other people's lives. What I do belongs to them and to my mother—her business, her legacy, her blood. Even the box of tears in my closet belongs to another woman, L.M.B. But now I've stolen the drum. And it seems to me, as I lie in the dark of my room, that my instinctive theft signifies something so essential that it might be called survival. I have stepped out of rules and laws and am breathing thin, new air. My theft is but the first of many I'll accomplish—though not of objects. There are other things I need and will have to have, other things I'll take. Thoughts, plans, private rages, and even joys, now secret to myself. I am usually a sound sleeper, but tonight, all night, it seems, I am listening. Thinking. So many ideas float in half-formed, and then veer off. Our old house ticks. Not regularly, like a clock, but softly all through itself as the slats in the walls change temperature or the plaster tightens or the earth shifts underneath the granite-slab foundation. From time to time, the little sounds that the house makes reverberate inside the drum. My breath does, too. I hear a rising, then a falling. In and out. A greatness, a lightness. I grow heavier, and then so inert that my body seems without life. Between breaths, I lose feeling. And then my chest fills, a resurrection. There is another thing that this house does in the deep of night. I have heard it before and now I wait for it to happen. The house releases the day's footsteps. All day we press down minutely on the wide old floorboards, moving about on regular errands, from room to room. It takes hours for the boards to readjust, to squeak back up the nails, for the old fibres of the pinewood to recover their give. As they do so, they reproduce the sound of the footsteps. In the night our maze of pathways is audibly retraced. I am used to it, as is Mother, but sometimes a wakeful guest is frightened. I can understand this. For now, as I rise and stand in half-darkness in the doorway of my bedroom, I hear the distinct creak of footsteps proceeding toward me, then past me, over to my bed. I feel the breath of my own passage, as though my dead self and my living self had briefly met in that doorway to sleep. ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

Fangfang and I had planned the trip over and over, even though we had only half a month off: ten days of wedding leave, plus one week of additional work leave. Getting married is a major event in life, and for us nothing was more important, so why not ask for some extra time? That director of mine was so miserly: anyone who went to him requesting leave had to haggle; there were never automatic approvals. The two weeks I had written in my application he changed to one week, including a Sunday, and it was with reluctance that he said, “I'll expect you to be back at work by the due date.” “Of course, of course,” I said. “We wouldn't be able to afford the salary deduction if we stayed longer.” It was only then that he signed his name, thereby granting us permission to leave. I wasn't a bachelor anymore. I had a family. I would no longer be able to go off to restaurants with friends as soon as I got paid at the beginning of the month. I wouldn't be able to spend recklessly so that by the end of the month I didn't have the money to buy a pack of cigarettes and had to go through my pockets and search the drawers for coins. But I won't go into all that. I'm saying that I—we were very happy. In our short lives, there hadn't been much happiness. Both Fangfang and I had experienced years of hardship, and we had learned how it is in the world. During those catastrophic years in this country, our families suffered through many misfortunes, and we still resented, to some extent, the fate of our generation. But I won't go into that, either, for the time being. What was important was that we could now count ourselves happy. We had half a month's leave, and although it was only half a honeymoon, for us it couldn't have been sweeter. I am not going to go into how sweet it was. You all know about that and have experienced it yourselves, but this particular sweetness was ours alone. What I want to tell you about is the Temple of Perfect Benevolence: “perfect” as in “perfect union,” and “benevolence” as in “benevolent love.” But the name of the temple is not really of great importance. It was a dilapidated ruin, and certainly not a famous tourist attraction. No one knew about it, other than the locals, and I suspect that even the locals who knew what it was called were few. In any case, the temple we happened to visit wasn't one where people burned incense or prayed, and if we hadn't carefully examined the stone tablet with traces of writing in the drain of the water pump we wouldn't even have known that the temple had a name. The locals referred to it as “the big temple,” but it was nothing compared with the Retreat for the Soul Temple, in Hangzhou, or the Jade Cloud Temple, in Beijing. Situated on a hill beyond the town, it was little more than an old two-story building with flying eaves and the remnants of a stone gate in front of it. The courtyard walls had collapsed. The bricks of the outer wall had been carried off by peasants to build their houses or construct pens for their pigs, and only a circle of unfired bricks remained, overgrown with weeds. However, from a distance, from the small street of the county town, the expanse of glazed yellow tiles sparkling in the sunlight caught our eyes. We had come to this town quite by accident. Our train had stayed at the platform after the announced departure time, probably waiting for an express that was behind schedule to pass through. The chaotic scramble of passengers getting on and off had settled and, apart from the conductors chatting at the carriage doors, there was no one on the platform. Beyond the station was a valley with an expanse of gray roofs. Farther still, a chain of heavily wooded mountains gave the ancient town an exceptional air of tranquillity. Suddenly I had an idea. I said, “Should we take a look at this town?” Fangfang, who was sitting opposite and looking at me lovingly, gave a slight nod. Those eyes of hers seemed to speak, and, sensitive to each other, we communicated on the same frequency. Without a word, we took our bags from the luggage rack and rushed to the door of our carriage. As soon as we had jumped onto the platform, we both laughed. I said, “We'll leave on the next train.” “I don't mind if we don't leave at all,” Fangfang answered. After all, we were travelling, and it was our honeymoon. If we fell in love with a place we would go there, and if we went on liking the place we would stay longer. The happiness of newlyweds accompanied us all the time, wherever we went. We were the happiest people in the world. Fangfang was holding my arm, and I was holding our bags. We wanted the conductors on the platform and the countless pairs of eyes on the other side of the train windows to look at us with envy. We no longer had to drive ourselves mad trying to get transferred back to the city. Nor did we have to keep appealing to our parents for help. And we didn't have to worry about our residential status or our jobs anymore. We even had our own apartment, our own home; it wasn't very big, but it was comfortable. You belonged to me and I belonged to you and, Fangfang, I know what you want to say: This relationship is no longer immoral! And what does that mean? It means that we want everyone to share in our happiness. We've had so many problems, and we've troubled all of you with them, and you have all worried because of us. How can we repay you? With some candies and cigarettes after our wedding? No, we are repaying you with our happiness. There's nothing wrong with what I'm saying, is there? So that was how we came to this quiet old town in the valley. But, in truth, the town was nowhere near as tranquil as it had seemed when we were looking out of the train window. Below the gray roof tiles, the lanes and alleys were throbbing with activity. It was nine o'clock in the morning, and people were selling vegetables and rock melons and freshly picked apples and pears. The streets of county towns like this one aren't wide, so mule carts, horse carts, and trucks were all jammed together, the drivers cracking their whips and sounding their horns. Dust in the air, dirty water tossed out by vegetable stalls, melon skins on the ground, squawking hens flapping in the hands of their buyers: these were sights that made us feel close to the town. It all felt so different from the time when we were graduates sent to work in the countryside. Now we were just visitors passing through; we were tourists, and the complicated relationships between the people here had nothing to do with us. Inevitably, this produced in us city-dwellers a sense of superiority. Fangfang was clutching my arm tightly and I was leaning close to her, and we could sense people's eyes on us. But we didn't belong to this town; we were from another world. We walked right by them, and they didn't gossip about us; they gossiped only about the people they knew. Eventually, there were no more vegetable stalls and very few people. We had left the bustle and din of the market behind. I saw from my watch that it had taken us only half an hour to walk the length of the main road from the railway station. It was still early. It would have been an anticlimax just to return to the station and wait for the next train, and Fangfang was already thinking about spending the night here! She didn't say so, but I could see that she was somewhat disappointed. There was a man heading toward us, ostentatiously swinging his arms as he walked. He was probably a cadre. “Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the county hostel?” I asked. He studied Fangfang and me for a moment, then enthusiastically pointed it out to us. “Go over there,” he told us, “then head left. The red brick three-story building is the county hostel.” He asked whom we were looking for, and he seemed to want to take us there himself. We explained that we were just tourists passing through and asked him if there were any sights worth seeing. He patted his head: this, it seemed, was a problem. After giving the matter some thought, he said, “There actually aren't any scenic spots in this county. But there's a big temple up on the hill to the west of town, if you want to go there. You'll have to climb the hill, though, and it's steep!” “That's O.K. We've come here so that we can go hiking,” I said. Fangfang hastened to add, “That's right. We're not afraid of climbing a hill.” At this, the man led us to the corner of the street. The hill was now directly in front of us, and on top of it, glazed tiles sparkling in the sun, was the old temple. But then the man glanced at the high-heeled shoes that Fangfang was wearing and said, “You'll have to wade across a river.” “Is the water deep?” I asked. “Above the knees.” I looked at Fangfang. “That's nothing. I'll manage.” She didn't want to disappoint me. We thanked him and began walking in the direction he had indicated. When we turned onto the dusty dirt road, I couldn't help feeling somewhat regretful as I looked at the new high-heeled shoes with thin straps that Fangfang had on. Still, she charged ahead. “You're really a crazy little thing,” I said, catching up to her. “As long as I'm with you.” Do you remember, Fangfang? You said this as you nestled against me. We walked toward the riverbank. Corn grew straight, taller than a man, on both sides, and we followed a path through the green gauze canopy, with no one in sight either ahead or behind. Taking Fangfang in my arms, I gently kissed her. What's wrong with that? She doesn't want me to talk about that. So let's go back to the Temple of Perfect Benevolence. It was on the other side of the river, at the top of the hill. We could see tufts of weeds growing between the glistening yellow tiles. The river was clear and cool. I held Fangfang's shoes and my leather sandals in one hand and Fangfang's hand in the other, while she scooped up her skirt with her free hand. Barefoot, we felt our way across. It had been a long time since I walked barefoot, so my feet were sensitive to even the smooth stones on the riverbed. “Is it hurting your feet?” I asked Fangfang. “I like it,” you replied softly. On our honeymoon, even having sore feet was a happy sensation. All the misfortunes of the world seemed to flow away with the river water, and we returned for a moment to our youth. We frolicked in the water like mischievous children. Fangfang leaped from rock to rock as I steadied her with one hand, and from time to time she hummed a song. After crossing the river, we started to run up the hill, laughing and shouting. Then Fangfang cut her foot and I was very upset, but she comforted me, saying that it was all right, it would be nothing as soon as she put on her shoes. I said that it was my fault, but she replied that she'd do anything to make me happy, even let her feet get cut. All right, all right, I won't go on about it. But because you are the friends we value most, who have shared our anxieties with us, we should also share our happiness with you. It was in this way that we finally climbed to the top of the hill and arrived at the outer gate in front of the temple. Within the collapsed courtyard wall there was a gutter with pure water from the pump running through it. In what had been the courtyard, someone had planted a patch of vegetables, and next to it was a manure pit. We recalled the years that we had spent shovelling manure with production units in the countryside. Those difficult times had trickled away like water, and there remained some grief but also sweet memories, and there was our love, too. In the glorious sunlight, no one could interfere with this secure love of ours. No one would be able to harm us again. Near the big temple there was also an iron incense burner. It was probably too heavy to move and too thick to break apart, so it continued to keep the old temple company, standing guard in front of the main door. The door was padlocked. Boards had been nailed over the rotten wooden lattice windows, but they, too, had rotted. The place was probably now being used as a storehouse for the local production team. No one else was around, and it was very peaceful. We could hear the mountain wind moaning in the ancient pines in front of the temple, and, as there was no one to disturb us, we lay down on the grass in the shade of the trees. Fangfang rested her head on my arm, and we looked up at a thread of cloud that was about to disappear into the blue sky. Ours was an indescribable happiness, a true contentment. We would have gone on lying there, intoxicated by this tranquillity, but we heard heavy footsteps on the flagstones. Fangfang sat up, and I got to my feet to have a look. A man was walking along the stone path from the gate toward the temple. He was a big fellow, with a mass of tangled hair and an untrimmed beard covering his cheeks. He was scowling. From beneath bushy eyebrows, his stern eyes surveyed us. The wind had turned cool. Probably noticing our curious looks, the man raised his head slightly in the direction of the temple. Then, squinting, he studied the weeds swaying among the shiny tiles. He stopped in front of the incense burner and, striking it with one hand, made it ring. His fingers, gnarled and rough, looked as if they, too, were made of cast iron. In his other hand he held a tattered black cotton bag. He didn't seem like a commune member who had come to tend the vegetables. He was sizing us up again, looking at Fangfang's high-heeled shoes and our travel bags in the grass. Fangfang immediately put her shoes back on. Then, unexpectedly, he addressed us. “Are you from out of town? Are you enjoying yourselves here?” I nodded. “It's good weather,” he said. He seemed to want to talk. The eyes under those thick eyebrows had become less stern, and he appeared well-meaning. He was wearing leather shoes with rubber-tire soles, and the seams had split in places. The legs of his trousers were wet, so he had clearly come across the river from town. “It's cool, and the view is quite beautiful,” I said. “Sit down. I'll be leaving shortly.” It seemed that he was offering a kind of apology. He, too, sat down on the grass beside the flagstones. He opened his bag and said, “Would you like a melon?” “No, thanks,” I said quickly. But he threw me a rock melon anyway. I caught it and was about to throw it back. “It's nothing. I've got half a bag of them here,” he said, raising the heavy bag to show me and taking out another melon as he spoke. I couldn't say no, so I took a parcel of snacks from my travel bag, opened it, and held it out to him. “Try our snacks,” I said. He took a small piece of cake and put it on top of his bag. “That's enough,” he said. “Go ahead and eat it.” He squeezed the melon in his big hands, cracking the brittle skin. “They're clean. I washed them in the river.” He tossed away the melon rind and shouted in the direction of the gate, “Take a break! Come and eat some melon!” “But there are long-horned grasshoppers here!” A boy's voice came from beyond the gate, then the boy himself appeared on the slope, holding a wire cage. “There are plenty of them. I'll catch some for you later,” the man replied. The little boy came toward us, bouncing and jumping as he ran. “Is it school vacation?” I asked and, copying the man, cracked our melon into pieces. “It's Sunday today, so I brought him out,” he replied. We were so intoxicated with our own holiday that we had forgotten what day of the week it was. Fangfang took a bite of the melon and smiled at me to indicate that he was a good man. There are, in fact, many good people in the world. “Eat it. It's from Uncle and Auntie over there,” he said to the boy, who was staring at the cream cake on top of his bag. The boy had grown up in this town and had clearly never seen such a cake. He took it and ate it right away. “Is he your son?” I asked. The man didn't reply, but said to the boy, “Take the melon and go play. I'll catch grasshoppers for you later.” “I want to catch five of them!” the boy said. “All right, we'll catch five.” The man watched him as he ran off with the wire cage in his hand. There were deep creases at the corners of his eyes. “He isn't my son,” he said, looking down and taking out a cigarette. Striking a match, he dragged hard. He perceived our surprise and added, “He's the child of my paternal cousin. I want to adopt him, but it depends on whether he's willing to come and stay with me.” Suddenly we understood that this stern man's heart was churning with emotion. “What about your wife?” Fangfang couldn't help asking. There was no reply. He puffed hard on his cigarette, got up, and left. We felt the chill of the mountain air. On the brilliant yellow tiles, the fresh grass that had sprouted in the spring was as tall as the old, withered stalks, and both swayed in the breeze. In the blue sky, a floating cloud that seemed to hang on the corner of a flying eave created the impression that the temple itself was tilting. A broken tile at the edge of the eave looked as if it were about to fall. Perhaps it had sat that way for years without falling. The man was standing on a mound that had once been a wall, and for a long time he just stared out at the mountains and valleys. In the distance were ridges that were higher and steeper than the hill we were on. There were no terraced fields on the mountain slopes and no houses to be seen. “You shouldn't have asked him,” I said. “Don't go on about it.” Fangfang looked aggrieved. “There's a grasshopper here!” The boy's voice came from the other side of the hill. It seemed far away but was very clear. The man strode off in his direction, swinging the bag of rock melons, and disappeared from sight. I put a hand on Fangfang's shoulder and pulled her toward me. “Don't.” She turned away. “There's a bit of grass in your hair,” I explained, removing a pine needle that had stuck to her hair. “That tile is about to fall,” Fangfang said. She, too, had noticed the broken tile that was hanging so precariously. “It would be good if it fell. Otherwise it might injure someone,” she mumbled. “It might be a while before it does fall,” I said. We walked to the mound where the man had been standing. In the valley there was a stretch of farmland, dense crops of luxuriant green barley and broomcorn millet, waiting for the autumn harvest. Below us, on a level part of the slope, were a few mud huts, their bottom halves newly coated in brilliant white lime. The man was holding the boy's hand as they made their way down a little winding track, past the huts and through the crops. Suddenly, like a colt that has broken free of its reins, the boy bolted off, dashing ahead then turning and running back. He seemed to be waving the cage at the man. “Do you think the man caught grasshoppers for him?” Fangfang, do you remember asking me that? “Of course,” I said. “Of course.” “He caught five of them!” you said cheekily. Well, that's the Temple of Perfect Benevolence that we visited on our honeymoon, and which I wanted to describe for all of you. ♦ (Translated, from the Chinese, by Mabel Lee.)

I first met him in a hotel at a ski resort, which is probably the perfect place to meet an ice man. The hotel lobby was crowded with animated young people, but the ice man was sitting by himself on a chair in the corner farthest from the fireplace, quietly reading a book. Although it was nearly noon, the clear, chilly light of an early-winter morning seemed to linger around him. “Look, that's an ice man,” my friend whispered. At the time, though, I had absolutely no idea what an ice man was. My friend didn't, either. “He must be made of ice. That's why they call him an ice man.” She said this to me with a serious expression, as if she were talking about a ghost or someone with a contagious disease. The ice man was tall, and he seemed to be young, but his stubby, wirelike hair had patches of white in it, like pockets of unmelted snow. His cheekbones stood out sharply, like frozen stone, and his fingers were rimed with a white frost that looked as if it would never melt. Otherwise, though, the ice man seemed like an ordinary man. He wasn't what you'd call handsome, but you could see that he might be very attractive, depending on how you looked at him. In any case, something about him pierced me to the heart, and I felt this, more than anywhere, in his eyes. His gaze was as silent and transparent as the splinters of light that pass through icicles on a winter morning. It was like the single glint of life in an artificial body. I stood there for a while and watched the ice man from a distance. He didn't look up. He just sat without moving, reading his book as though there were no one else around him. The next morning, the ice man was in the same place again, reading a book in exactly the same way. When I went to the dining room for lunch, and when I came back from skiing with my friends that evening, he was still there, directing the same gaze onto the pages of the same book. The same thing happened the day after that. Even when the sun sank low, and the hour grew late, he sat in his chair, as quiet as the winter scene outside the window. On the afternoon of the fourth day, I made up some excuse not to go out on the slopes. I stayed in the hotel by myself and loitered for a while in the lobby, which was as empty as a ghost town. The air there was warm and moist, and the room had a strangely dejected smell—the smell of snow that had been tracked in on the soles of people's shoes and was now melting in front of the fireplace. I looked out the windows, rustled through the pages of a newspaper or two, and then went over to the ice man, gathered my nerve, and spoke. I tend to be shy with strangers and, unless I have a very good reason, I don't usually talk to people I don't know. But I felt compelled to talk to the ice man no matter what. It was my last night at the hotel, and if I let this chance go by I feared I would never get to talk with an ice man again. “Don't you ski?” I asked him, as casually as I could. He turned his face toward me slowly, as if he'd heard a noise in the distance, and he stared at me with those eyes. Then he calmly shook his head. “I don't ski,” he said. “I just like to sit here and read and look at the snow.” His words formed white clouds above him, like comic-strip captions. I could actually see the words in the air, until he rubbed them away with a frost-rimed finger. I had no idea what to say next. I just blushed and stood there. The ice man looked into my eyes and seemed to smile slightly. “Would you like to sit down?” he asked. “You're interested in me, aren't you? You want to know what an ice man is.” Then he laughed. “Relax, there's nothing to worry about. You won't catch a cold just by talking to me.” We sat side by side on a sofa in the corner of the lobby and watched the snowflakes dance outside the window. I ordered a hot cocoa and drank it, but the ice man didn't drink anything. He didn't seem to be any better at conversation than I was. Not only that, but we didn't seem to have anything in common to talk about. At first, we talked about the weather. Then we talked about the hotel. “Are you here by yourself?” I asked the ice man. “Yes,” he answered. He asked me if I liked skiing. “Not very much,” I said. “I only came because my friends insisted. I actually rarely ski at all.” There were so many things I wanted to know. Was his body really made of ice? What did he eat? Where did he live in the summer? Did he have a family? Things like that. But the ice man didn't talk about himself, and I held back from asking personal questions. Instead, the ice man talked about me. I know it's hard to believe, but he somehow knew all about me. He knew about the members of my family; he knew my age, my likes and dislikes, the state of my health, the school I was attending, and the friends I was seeing. He even knew things that had happened to me so far in the past that I had long since forgotten them. “I don't understand,” I said, flustered. I felt as if I were naked in front of a stranger. “How do you know so much about me? Can you read people's minds?” “No, I can't read minds or anything like that. I just know,” the ice man said. “I just know. It's as if I were looking deep into ice, and, when I look at you like this, things about you become clearly visible to me.” I asked him, “Can you see my future?” “I can't see the future,” he said slowly. “I can't take any interest in the future at all. More precisely, I have no conception of a future. That's because ice has no future. All it has is the past enclosed within it. Ice is able to preserve things that way—very cleanly and distinctly and as vividly as though they were still alive. That's the essence of ice.” “That's nice,” I said and smiled. “I'm relieved to hear that. After all, I don't really want to know what my future is.” We met again a number of times once we were back in the city. Eventually, we started dating. We didn't go to movies, though, or to coffee shops. We didn't even go to restaurants. The ice man rarely ate anything to speak of. Instead, we always sat on a bench in the park and talked about things—anything except the ice man himself. “Why is that?” I asked him once. “Why don't you talk about yourself? I want to know more about you. Where were you born? What are your parents like? How did you happen to become an ice man?” The ice man looked at me for a while, and then he shook his head. “I don't know,” he said quietly and clearly, exhaling a puff of white words into the air. “I know the past of everything else. But I myself have no past. I don't know where I was born, or what my parents looked like. I don't even know if I had parents. I have no idea how old I am. I don't know if I have an age at all.” The ice man was as lonely as an iceberg in the dark night. I fell seriously in love with this ice man. The ice man loved me just as I was—in the present, without any future. In turn, I loved the ice man just as he was—in the present, without any past. We even started to talk about getting married. I had just turned twenty, and the ice man was the first person I had really loved. At the time, I couldn't begin to imagine what it meant to love an ice man. But even if I'd fallen in love with a normal man I doubt I'd have had a clearer idea of what love meant. My mother and my older sister were strongly opposed to my marrying the ice man. “You're too young to get married,” they said. “Besides, you don't know a thing about his background. You don't even know where he was born or when. How could we possibly tell our relatives that you're marrying someone like that? Plus, this is an ice man we're talking about, and what are you going to do if he suddenly melts away? You don't seem to understand that marriage requires a real commitment.” Their worries were unfounded, though. After all, an ice man isn't really made of ice. He isn't going to melt, no matter how warm it gets. He's called an ice man because his body is as cold as ice, but what he's made of is different from ice, and it's not the kind of cold that takes away other people's heat. So we got married. Nobody blessed the wedding, and no friends or relatives were happy for us. We didn't hold a ceremony, and, when it came to having my name entered in his family register, well, the ice man didn't even have one. We just decided, the two of us, that we were married. We bought a little cake and ate it together, and that was our modest wedding. We rented a tiny apartment, and the ice man made a living by working at a cold-storage meat facility. He could take any amount of cold, and he never felt tired, no matter how hard he worked. So the ice man's employer liked him very much, and paid him a better salary than the other employees. The two of us lived a happy life together, without bothering or being bothered by anyone. When the ice man made love to me, I saw in my mind a piece of ice that I was sure existed somewhere in quiet solitude. I thought that the ice man probably knew where that piece of ice was. It was frozen hard, so hard that I thought nothing could be harder. It was the biggest piece of ice in the world. It was somewhere very far away, and the ice man was passing on the memories of that ice to me and to the world. At first, I felt confused when the ice man made love to me. But, after a while, I got used to it. I even started to love having sex with the ice man. In the night, we silently shared that enormous piece of ice, in which hundreds of millions of years—all the pasts of the world—were stored. There were no problems to speak of in our married life. We loved each other deeply, and nothing came between us. We wanted to have a child, but that didn't seem to be possible. It may have been that human genes and ice-man genes didn't combine easily. In any case, it was partly because we didn't have children that I found myself with time on my hands. I would finish up all the housework in the morning, and then have nothing to do. I didn't have any friends to talk to or go out with, and I didn't have much to do with the people in our neighborhood, either. My mother and sister were still angry with me for marrying the ice man and showed no sign of ever wanting to see me again. And although, as the months passed, the people around us started talking to him from time to time, deep in their hearts they still hadn't accepted the ice man or me, who had married him. We were different from them, and no amount of time could bridge the gap between us. So, while the ice man was working, I stayed at home by myself, reading books and listening to music. I tend to prefer staying at home, anyway, and I don't especially mind being alone. But I was still young, and doing the same thing day after day eventually began to bother me. It wasn't the boredom that hurt. It was the repetition. That was why I said to my husband one day, “How would it be if the two of us went away on a trip somewhere, just for a change?” “A trip?” the ice man said. He narrowed his eyes and stared at me. “What on earth would we take a trip for? Aren't you happy being here with me?” “It's not that,” I said. “I am happy. But I'm bored. I feel like travelling somewhere far away and seeing things that I've never seen before. I want to see what it's like to breathe new air. Do you understand? Besides, we haven't even had our honeymoon yet. We have some savings, and you have plenty of vacation days coming to you. Isn't it about time that we got away somewhere and took it easy for a while?” The ice man heaved a deep frozen sigh. It crystallized in midair with a ringing sound. He laced his long fingers together on his knees. “Well, if you really want to go on a trip so badly, I don't have anything against it. I'll go anywhere if it'll make you happy. But do you know where you want to go?” “How about visiting the South Pole?” I said. I chose the South Pole because I was sure that the ice man would be interested in going somewhere cold. And, to be honest, I had always wanted to travel there. I wanted to wear a fur coat with a hood, and I wanted to see the aurora australis and a flock of penguins. When I said this, my husband looked straight into my eyes, without blinking, and I felt as if a pointed icicle were piercing all the way through to the back of my head. He was silent for a while, and finally he said, in a glinting voice, “All right, if that's what you want, then let's go to the South Pole. You're really sure that this is what you want?” I wasn't able to answer right away. The ice man's stare had been on me so long that the inside of my head felt numb. Then I nodded. As time passed, though, I came to regret ever having brought up the idea of going to the South Pole. I don't know why, but it seemed that as soon as I spoke the words “South Pole” to my husband something changed inside him. His eyes became sharper, his breath came out whiter, and his fingers were frostier. He hardly talked to me anymore, and he stopped eating entirely. All of this made me feel very insecure. Five days before we were supposed to leave, I got up my nerve and said, “Let's forget about going to the South Pole. When I think about it now, I realize that it's going to be terribly cold there, and it might not be good for our health. I'm starting to think that it might be better for us to go someplace more ordinary. How about Europe? Let's go have a real vacation in Spain. We can drink wine, eat paella, and see a bullfight or something.” But my husband paid no attention to what I was saying. He stared off into space for a few minutes. Then he declared, “No, I don't particularly want to go to Spain. Spain is too hot for me. It's too dusty, and the food is too spicy. Besides, I've already bought tickets for the South Pole. And we've got a fur coat and fur-lined boots for you. We can't let all that go to waste. Now that we've come this far, we can't not go.” The truth is that I was scared. I had a premonition that if we went to the South Pole something would happen to us that we might not be able to undo. I was having this bad dream over and over again. It was always the same. I'd be out taking a walk and I'd fall into a deep crevasse that had opened up in the ground. Nobody would find me, and I'd freeze down there. Shut up inside the ice, I'd stare up at the sky. I'd be conscious, but I wouldn't be able to move, not even a finger. I'd realize that moment by moment I was becoming the past. As people looked at me, at what I'd become, they were looking at the past. I was a scene moving backward, away from them. Then I'd wake up and find the ice man sleeping beside me. He always slept without breathing, like a dead man. But I loved the ice man. I cried, and my tears dripped onto his cheek and he woke up and held me in his arms. “I had a bad dream,” I told him. “It was only a dream,” he said. “Dreams come from the past, not the future. You aren't bound by them. The dreams are bound by you. Do you understand that?” “Yes,” I said, though I wasn't convinced. I couldn't find a good reason to cancel the trip, so in the end my husband and I boarded a plane for the South Pole. The stewardesses were all taciturn. I wanted to look at the view out the window, but the clouds were so thick that I couldn't see anything. After a while, the window was covered with a layer of ice. My husband sat silently reading a book. I felt none of the excitement of heading off on a vacation. I was just going through the motions and doing things that had already been decided on. When we went down the stairs and stepped off onto the ground of the South Pole, I felt my husband's body lurch. It lasted less than a blink of an eye, just half a second, and his expression didn't change at all, but I saw it happen. Something inside the ice man had been secretly, violently shaken. He stopped and looked at the sky, then at his hands. He heaved a huge breath. Then he looked at me and grinned. He said, “Is this the place you wanted to visit?” “Yes,” I said. “It is.” The South Pole was lonely beyond anything I had expected. Almost no one lived there. There was just one small, featureless town, and in that town there was one hotel, which was, of course, also small and featureless. The South Pole was not a tourist destination. There wasn't a single penguin. And you couldn't see the aurora australis. There were no trees, flowers, rivers, or ponds. Everywhere I went, there was only ice. Everywhere, as far as I could see, the wasteland of ice stretched on and on. My husband, though, walked enthusiastically from place to place as if he couldn't get enough of it. He learned the local language quickly, and spoke with the townspeople in a voice that had the hard rumble of an avalanche. He conversed with them for hours with a serious expression on his face, but I had no way of knowing what they were talking about. I felt as though my husband had betrayed me and left me to care for myself. There, in that wordless world surrounded by thick ice, I eventually lost all my strength. Bit by bit, bit by bit. In the end, I didn't even have the energy to feel irritated anymore. It was as though I had lost the compass of my emotions somewhere. I had lost track of where I was heading, I had lost track of time, and I had lost all sense of my own self. I don't know when this started or when it ended, but when I regained consciousness I was in a world of ice, an eternal winter drained of all color, closed in alone. Even after most of my sensation had gone, I still knew this much. My husband at the South Pole was not the same man as before. He looked out for me just as he had always done, and he spoke to me kindly. I could tell that he truly meant the things he said to me. But I also knew that he was no longer the ice man I had met in the hotel at the ski resort. There was no way I could bring this to anybody's attention, though. Everyone at the South Pole liked him, and, anyway, they couldn't understand a word I said. Puffing out their white breath, they would tell jokes and argue and sing songs in their own language while I sat by myself in our room, looking out at a gray sky that was unlikely to clear for months to come. The airplane that had brought us there had long since gone, and after a while the runway was covered with a hard layer of ice, just like my heart. “Winter has come,” my husband said. “It's going to be a very long winter, and there will be no more planes, or ships, either. Everything has frozen over. It looks as though we'll have to stay here until next spring.” About three months after we arrived at the South Pole, I realized that I was pregnant. The child that I gave birth to would be a little ice man—I knew this. My womb had frozen over, and my amniotic fluid was slush. I could feel its chill inside me. My child would be just like his father, with eyes like icicles and frost-rimed fingers. And our new family would never again set foot outside the South Pole. The eternal past, heavy beyond all comprehension, had us in its grasp. We would never shake it off. Now there's almost no heart left in me. My warmth has gone very far away. Sometimes I forget that warmth ever existed. In this place, I am lonelier than anyone else in the world. When I cry, the ice man kisses my cheek, and my tears turn to ice. He takes those frozen teardrops in his hand and puts them on his tongue. “See how I love you,” he says. He is telling the truth. But a wind sweeping in from nowhere blows his white words back and back into the past. ♦ (Translated, from the Japanese, by Richard L. Peterson.)

"Look, that's an ice man," my friend whispered. The iceman was tall, and he seemed to be young, but his fingers were rimed with a white frost that looked as if it would never melt. Something about him pierced me to the heart. I made up some excuse not to go out, and stayed in the hotel. I felt compelled to talk to the ice man no matter what. "I don't ski," he said. "I just like to sit here and read and look at the snow. You're interested in me, aren't you? You want to know what an ice man is." I held back from asking personal questions. Instead, the iceman talked about me. Somehow, he knew all about me. "How do you know so much about me?" "I can't read minds or anything. I just know." Eventually we started dating. We always sat on a bench in the park and talked." "Why don't you talk about yourself? How did you come to be an ice man?" "I don't know. I don't even know if I had parents." I fell seriously in love with this ice man. The ice man loved me just as I wasóin the present. My mother and my older sister were strongly opposed to my marrying the ice man. "You don't know a thing about his background." So we got married. Nobody blessed the wedding, and no friends or relatives were happy for us. We rented a tiny apartment, and the ice man made a living by working at a cold-storage meat facility The two of us lived a happy life together, without bothering or being bothered by anyone. I even started to love having sex with the ice man. We wanted to have a child but that didn't seem to be possible. It may have been that human genes and ice-man genes didn't combine easily. I found myself with time on my hands. I would finish up all the housework, and then having nothing to do. I was still young, and doing the same thing day after day. "How would it be if the two of us went away on a trip somewhere, just for a change?" "Well, if you really want to go on a trip so badly, I don't have anything against it." "How about visiting the South Pole?" It seemed as soon as I spoke the words "South Pole," something changed inside him. I had a premonition that if we went to the South Pole something would happen to us, but I couldn't find a good reason to cancel the trip. When we stepped off onto the ground of the South Pole I felt my husbands body lurch. something inside the ice man had been secretly violently shaken. He walked enthusiastically from place to place as if he couldn't get enough of it. He learned the local language quickly. I felt as though my husband had betrayed me and left me to care for myself. I eventually lost my strength. The airplane that had brought us there wad long since gone, and the runway was covered with ice. "Winter has come It looks as though we'll have to stay here until next spring." About three months after we arrived, I realized I was pregnant. The child would be a little ice man. I could feel its chill inside me, Our new family would never again set foot outside the South Pole. I am lonelier than anyone else in the world.

The ancient Chinese man was a brown, knotted, shrivelled man who looked like a chunk of gingerroot and ran one of those tiny stores that sell grapefruits, wine, and toilet paper, and no one can ever figure out how they survive. But he survived, he figured it out. His ancient Chinese wife was a little twig of a woman who sat in a chair and never said a word. He spoke only enough English to conduct business, to say hello and goodbye, to make change, although every morning, when I came for my grapefruit, I tried to teach him some useful vocabulary. I came out of the gray drizzle through the glass door with the old Fishback Appliance Repair sign still stencilled on it, a copper cowbell clanging above me, and the store was cold, the lights weren't even on. I went to the bin and picked through the grapefruits and found one that wasn't bad, a yellow ball, soft and square from sitting too long in the box, and then I went to the counter. The Chinese man wasn't there. His tiny branchlike wife was sitting in her chair, all bent up. I searched my pockets for show, knowing all along that I'd be a little short. I came up with twenty-seven cents, half a paper clip, a pen cap, and a ball of blue lint. I put the money in her hand and she stared at it. By the lonesome sound my nickels and pennies made when she sorted them into their slots I also knew that the till was empty. I looked behind her through the beaded curtain to the small apartment behind the shop. Next to the kitchen sink was an apple with a bite out of it, the bite turned brown like an old laugh. I held my grapefruit, tossed it up in the air, caught it. Where is he? I asked. She was chewing on a slice of ginger and offered me a piece, which I accepted. In the morning, they chewed ginger instead of drinking coffee. Husband? I said. She blinked and spat on the floor. Meiyou xiwang, she said. Meiyou xiwang. She folded her hands, tangling the tiny brown roots together. Meiyou xiwang, she said, touching her heart, and sending her hands flying apart. Her singsong voice beat an echo against the bare walls. Her hands flapped like a bat. I shook my head. Meiyou xiwang, she insisted. Huh? I said, but I knew we could go on forever not making any sense. She hugged herself, like she was cold. I didn't know what to say. She'd travelled all this way, she'd left China and crossed the ocean and come to Bremerton and opened a little store and put grapefruit in the bins and Mogen David on the shelves, but she'd gone too far, because now she couldn't tell anybody what was happening to her anymore. I had two projects at the Home. I was reading the encyclopedia, working through the whole circle of learning available to man, as the introduction said. I'd started with Ignatius Loyola, because I'm named after him, and the Inquisition, and this led me right into the topic of torture. My other project involved learning Latin so I could be an altar boy. I got the idea one morning at Sacred Heart while I was staring at the cold altar and the Cross and winking at the nailed-up Christ to see if he'd wink back. Our priest said that he didn't go for the vernacular because it was vulgar. If you were God Eternal, he said, would you want to listen to such yowling? He said that everything in the Church was a sign for something else, and a priest was a man who knew all the signs, but an altar boy knew a few of them, too. I looked around the sanctuary. With the snowy marble slab of altar, the gilt dome of the tabernacle and its tiny doors, the chalices and cruets, the fresh-cut flowers, the sparkling candlelight, the sanctuary was like a foreign country, and if I knew the language I could go there. Several times I read the Missal as far as the Minor Elevation, the part of the Mass just after you pray for the dead. Per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen. World without end. Amen. But I was trying to learn Latin with phonetics—the Missal was Latin on one side, English on the other—and, needless to say, my comprehension was zero, and I was always finding myself back at the beginning, starting over. Per omnia saecula saeculorum, amen! Most of our schoolwork focussed on how to get into Heaven. Sister Eulalia, the catechism nun, taught us about sin and the opportunities for salvation. She was a short, wide old woman with thick glasses and blue eyes that drifted behind them like tropical fish. She kept calling Jesus the Holy Victim and the Word Made Flesh and the Unspotted Sacrifice. She said that sacrifice didn't mean to kill but to make holy. We are made in the image of God's great mystery but through our ignorance and despair our vision is clouded. Salvation, she told us, is our presence in a bright light where we at last become the perfect image and reflection of our Creator. We saw a slide show on the scapular. A boy was riding by a gas station on his bicycle. A man was pumping gas and a family was waiting in a car. Then the gas station was blowing up and the boy was flying through the air. Everybody died but the boy, who was wearing his scapular. Sister Eulalia passed around blank order forms and said to fill them out and bring $2.50 if you thought it was prudent to have a scapular for yourself. I'd spent all my money on grapefruits, though. At night, in bed, I practiced my prayers. We had to memorize so many at the Home: Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be, Act of Faith, of Hope, of Love, of Contrition. Praying either put me to sleep or made me think of girls. Once, I passed a girl a note during class and Sister Josephine, the discipline nun, intercepted it and said someone my age doesn't know the least thing about love and shouldn't use that word the way I did. That kind of love is special, she said. It's a rare gift from God, it's the consummation of a union, and it's certainly nothing for children. Sister Josephine called it The Marriage Act. It's embarrassing for me to admit, but she made me cry, she was yelling so much. I never sent another note. Still, I attached a vague feeling of hope to different girls, a feeling of, I don't know, of whatever, that came out, some nights, when I said prayers. We had to learn the prayers because we prayed for everything: we prayed for food, we prayed for sleep, we prayed for new basketballs. Three times a day, Sister Catherine, the food nun, took us to the church cafeteria for our meals. Volunteer ladies served us—they were all old and kind and had science-fiction hair, clouds of blue gas, burning white-hot rocket fuel, explosions of atomic frizz. I loved the endless stacks of white bread and the cold slabs of butter. When the nuns said I was underfoot, I went downstairs and studied the encyclopedias or read Latin or went outside and shot buses with my pump gun. Buses passed the Home every twenty-six minutes. I built up my arm pitching rocks at a tree until a circle of pulpy white wood was exposed in the bark. One afternoon I planted a sunflower in a milk carton. I longed to go somewhere but there wasn't anywhere good that I knew of. Then one day I found the public-school yard. What're you doing here, you stupid shit? asked one kid, a pudgy boy with skin like a baby. He and some other boys pushed around me in a circle. The pudge said, Who are you? When I didn't answer, he said, You're one of those orphan bastards, right? The boys crowded in closer and I was afraid to speak. People could tell you were from the Home by your haircut. We were all shaved up like the Dalai Lama. Finally, I smiled and mumbled, If you say so. What? the pudge said. I didn't hear you. The circle of boys cinched like a knot. Their looming heads were way up in the sky. Yeah, I said. After that I sat below the monkey bars and chewed a butter sandwich and watched pudge-boy and his gang over by the water fountain with some girls and I knew I was going to have to kick his ass sooner or later. Everything else was new and strange but this seemed predictable and something I could rely on. That spring the pudge had the nerve to try out for baseball. He wore brand-new cleats and threw like a fem and his mitt, also brand-new, very orange and stiff, wouldn't close. He might as well have been standing in right field with a piece of toast. He dropped everything. The second day of practice, we had an intrasquad game and I nailed him three times. I just chose places on his fat body and threw the ball at them. Eventually, pudge-boy was afraid to stand in the batter's box. The coach thought I had a control problem but I didn't. My control was perfect. I whiffed nine guys and made the team and the pudge was cut. He walked away, crying. I ran down the hill and jumped on his back. I hit him in the face and the neck and beat on his ear over and over. You hear that? I shouted. You hear that, you fat fucker? Now that I had him alone I was insane. The pudge rolled away on the grass, holding his ear. Blood was coming out. He was bawling, and I hawked a gob of spit right into his black, wailing mouth and said, You bastard. That night, I was asleep with the encyclopedia pitched like a tent over my nose when Sister Celestine, the head nun, came in. Why weren't you at dinner? I could hear the polished rocks of Sister Celestine's rosary rattling as she worried them between her fingers. She pulled the encyclopedia off my head. Won't you talk? Sister said. She tucked a dry, stray shaft of hair back beneath her habit. Maybe you'd feel more comfortable making a confession? I picked at the fuzzballs on my blanket. I just got off the phone with that boy's mother, she said. She touched a cut on my lip and took a deep breath. She said you called him a name. Do you know what that name means? I shook my head. She took off her scapular and put it around my neck. Two small pieces of brown wool hung on a cord, one in back, the other in front. I rubbed the wool between my finger and thumb. It's not magic, she said. No? More like a sign, she said, that helps guide people—she paused—like us. When you pray to it you never say Amen, because the prayer is continuous. It doesn't have an end. Before I received my calling, she said, I used to be a lot like you. I felt trapped. It was like I lived in a dark little corner of my own mind. She sighed. Ignatius, do you know what the opposite of love is? Hate, I said. Despair, Sister said. Despair is the opposite of love. When the pudge came to the yard, he was obviously beat up and everybody wanted to know what happened. Before I could say anything, he came charging across the lot and said, Truce, truce. We shook hands and sat under the monkey bars, which had become my private territory. I thought Catholics were pansies, he said. Ignatius Loyola was a warrior, I said. That's a weird name, the pudge said. My name's Donny. Ignatius, I told him. I'm sorry I called you a bastard, Donny said. He peeled a strip of red rubber off his tennis shoe and stretched and snapped it in the air. Then he put it in his mouth and chewed on it. You should meet my dad, he said. My dad used to race pigeons, I said. He had about a hundred of them. Donny looked impressed. How do you race pigeons? he asked. You just drive out to the country and let them go—they always find their way back to the coop. You can use pigeons to send messages. My dad ate a pigeon once, Donny said. In France. Donny told me about the Eurekan Territory, which was something he'd made up on summer vacation. The Eurekan Territory came from Eureka, California, where he had relatives he didn't like. All they did was drink greyhounds, he said, and talk about people you didn't know. They were always slapping their knees and saying Gosh, isn't that funny? when nothing was funny. Donny wasn't a Catholic but I let him wear my scapular, which he kept on calling a spatula. You should come over to our house, Donny said. It's big. My dad rakes it in. I said, You want to go see my dad? Donny looked at me. Where? he said. What do you mean, where? Isn't he dead? Follow me, I said. St. Jude's Hospital was a huge old brick building. A hurricane fence caged in a patio that was scattered with benches and garbage cans. We walked around the fence, plucking the cold wires with our fingers. My dad was sitting on a bench with a loaf of bread and an orange. He wore a paper nightgown with snaps in the back. His eyes were like blown fuses, and dry white yuck made a crust around his mouth. Wind ruffled his hair. It was too cold to be outside in a paper outfit. Don't you want a sweater? I said. I climbed up the chain-link fence. This is my friend Donny, I said. Donny, this is my dad, Tony Banner. Dad was barefoot on one foot and wore a foam-rubber slipper on the other. He grabbed the fence and the links shivered. He looked out west, toward the Olympic Mountains, and we looked, too. It was getting dark. Hey, Dad? What? He dropped a piece of bread through the fence, and a couple of cooing pigeons bobbed along the gutter and fought each other for it. They were ugly pigeons, dirty like a sidewalk. They were right under me and Donny's feet. I kicked one in the head. It fell over, and beat the dirt with its wings. I'm learning quite a lot of prayers at school, I said. That got him to laugh. The cuts on his hands were healing. That last week at our house he emptied all the soup cans in the garage and kept the rusty nails in his pockets. One morning for breakfast he served me a bowl of nails with milk and then squeezed a fistful of them in his hand until blood came out. He kept saying with his voice very loud and fast, I got the nails, I got the nails right here, boy—where's my cross, eh? Now he was gentle. He pushed bread through the fence until the loaf was gone and the pigeons flew away, except the one I'd kicked. I gotta go home and eat, Donny said to me. Donny's gotta go home and eat, I told my dad, translating for him. I've got to go eat, too. I turned around once, real quick, and he was gripping the fence, looking off nowhere, then Donny and I crawled through a hole in the hedge. Donny's dad asked us, Who wants to get the hell out of here? Who wants to go hiking in the Olympics? I'd spent most of my summer at Donny's house, so I knew his parents. Mrs. Cheetam was a beautiful woman with silver-and-gold hair. Mr. Cheetam was a travelling salesman and wasn't home much but it was true, he raked it in. They bought Donny everything. Donny told me he had a sister who died of leukemia. He played me a cassette of her last farewell. Near the end of the tape she said, Donny? I love you, remember that. I want you to know that wherever I am, and wherever you are, I'll be watching. I'll be with you always. I love you. Do you hear me? Donny? When she said that—I love you. Do you hear me? Donny?—I got a lonely sort of chill. We're now leaving the Eurekan Territory! Donny said as we drove away, and I said, That's right. Goodbye, Eurekan Territory! Mr. Cheetam listened to different tapes from a big collection he kept in a suitcase. They were old radio shows, and one I liked was called “The Shadow”: Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? Mr. Cheetam and Donny knew all the words and talked right along with the tapes. The Shadow knows, they said, ha ha ha! Later Donny woke up and asked, Where are we? Mr. Cheetam said, You see that river there, Donny? That's the Quinault River, and we're going to hike up along what's called the High Divide, and when we get to the top we'll be at the source of that river. You'll be able to skip right over it, he said, so remember how big it is now. Donny asked, What if we see the Sasquatch? I said we'd be famous, if we captured it. Or took a picture, Donny said. But I don't want to see it, he added. We parked at the ranger station and signed in. It was silent and we could hear our feet crunching the gravel. We cinched up our pack straps and looked at each other. This is it, Mr. Cheetam said. He looked up the trail. This is where we separate the men from the boys. After about an hour, we cut off the main path and headed toward the river. This is where I buried my dad, Mr. Cheetam explained. I always visit once a year. Right beside the river was a tree, hanging over the water and shadowing everything. Initials were carved in the tree on the side facing the river. B.C. is Billy Cheetam, Donny said. That's my grandpa. Is he under the tree? I asked. No, no, Mr. Cheetam laughed. He was cremated and I scattered his ashes in the river. But this is the spot, he said. The river was deep and wide at that point. Mr. Cheetam asked if he and Donny could be alone to think and remember and I hiked back out to the main trail. I sat against a fallen log until Donny came back. He talks to him, Donny said. What's he say? I asked, but Donny didn't know. Our first camp was disappointing because we could hear Boy Scouts hooting and farting around, a troop of about sixty in green uniforms with red or yellow hankies around their necks. It was like the Army, with pup tents everywhere. Mr. Cheetam said not to worry, higher up there won't be any Scouts. We found wood and lit a campfire and made dinner—beef Stroganoff—and I sopped up all the gravy with my fingers. We washed the pots and pans with pebbles and sand in the river. Mr. Cheetam drank whiskey from a silver flask, wiping his lips and saying, Aaahhh, this is living! The Boy Scouts sounded off with taps. Donny and I shared a smokewood stogie—a kind of gray stick you could smoke—and when it was quiet Mr. Cheetam cupped his hands around his mouth and moaned, Who stole my Golden Arm? Whooooo stoooole myyyy Goool-den Aaaarm? You could hear his voice echoing in the forest. Whoo stooole my Gooolden Aaarm? You did! Mr. Cheetam shouted, grabbing Donny. We crawled into our tents and I started laughing and Donny got hysterical, too. Mr. Cheetam had a different tent and told us to shut up. Donny whispered how he hated the Japs and never wanted to be captured by them—they knew how to make you talk. I told him about the Inquisition and all the tortures they'd invented for getting confessions. They had this one thing called the press, I said. If you were accused of a crime and didn't make a plea, the King ordered you to lie down. Then he piled rocks on you until you confessed the truth or got crushed. How big were the rocks? Donny asked. I don't know. What if you had thirty—what if you had a hundred—no, wait, what if you had a thousand rocks on you and then you decided to tell the truth? You could, I said. But if you said you didn't do anything, the King didn't want to hear that, and he'd just go ahead with another rock, until you admitted you did do it. Donny hesitated, and I thought I understood. I know, I said. I know. At the next camp, only two people were around, a man and a woman, who were sitting naked on a rock in the river when we first arrived, but kept to themselves afterward. Donny and Mr. Cheetam fished for a while but quit after Donny's hook got caught in the trees too many times. Mr. Cheetam said, Don't worry about it, Donny. It's no good down here. Higher up the water's colder and we'll catch tons of rainbows, maybe some Dolly Varden. We ate a great meal of dehydrated chicken tetrazzini and pilot biscuits and chocolate for dessert. Donny and I shared more smokewood. Now and then we added sticks to the fire and the light breathed out and made a circle around us. I love getting away from it all, Mr. Cheetam said. He tipped back his flask and in the bright curved silver I could see the fire flaming up. Once upon a time, Mr. Cheetam said, there was a boy and girl who were very much in love. Where was this? Donny asked. Oh, Mr. Cheetam said, it doesn't matter, does it? Love's the same everywhere you go, so let's just make up a place. How about the Eurekan Territory? I said. O.K., Mr. Cheetam said. The Eurekan Territory, that's where they were in love. It was a small place, and everybody knew everybody else, so eventually people figured out this boy and girl had a thing going. You know what a thing is, right? Donny said he did. Good for you, Mr. Cheetam said. Well, this thing was frowned on by everyone. People took different sides, against the boy, or against the girl, everybody blaming everybody else. But the boy and girl were madly in love and you can't stop love, not when it's the real thing. He went to his pack and pulled out a big bottle and refilled his flask. When he came back he said, You know what that's like, to have a real thing? Donny said, Yeah, I know. I mean really real, Mr. Cheetam said. How real? I said. Mr. Cheetam ignored me. To hell with what anybody thinks, these kids, these lovers, said. So one night the boy meets the girl on the edge of town and they drive up a dark winding road to a lover's leap. They can see everything from up there, but they're not looking. No siree, Bob. The boy and the girl sit in the car, spooning, as we used to call it back in the day—making out, and listening to love songs on the radio, until one of the songs is interrupted by a special bulletin. A prisoner has escaped! Does the prisoner have hooks instead of hands? I asked. Yeah, Mr. Cheetam said, that's the guy. How'd you know? Donny asked. I knew because the story wasn't true. The girl hears something outside, and the boy says, Oh, baby baby, don't worry, we're way up here above everything, we're safe. The boy tries to get at the girl, and the girl keeps hearing something outside. Eventually it's no fun, and they go home. When the boy opens the door for the girl to drop her out he finds a hook clawing and banging at the door handle, just clinging there, ripped right off the prisoner's arm. Mr. Cheetam didn't scare me, but Donny was scared. We were quiet for a minute, and then I told them about when my dad was driving in his car. The other car came out of nowhere, I said. And my dad was hanging half out the door. His foot was stuck under the clutch and his head was banging on the road. He was dragged about two hundred feet. He was in the hospital for a month. My mom died. No one said anything, so I added, That's a true life story. You don't think mine was? Mr. Cheetam asked. He looked at me strangely and winked. Well, I said, yeah, I do. I know it is. I heard about those lovers before. Mr. Cheetam stood up, stretched, and fell down. Donny and I looked at each other, then we got in our sleeping bags. Your dad sure enjoys whiskey, I said. In the middle of the night, Donny said, Hey, you hear that? Come off it, I said. I swear I heard something. There's nothing out there, I said, but Donny went over to sleep in his dad's tent anyway. We reached a sign that pointed different ways: the High Divide and the Low Divide. We took the high, up and up. There were fewer trees, and we climbed on loose rock called scree, and the air was thinner. Donny had an ugly blister on his heel and complained, and Mr. Cheetam got impatient with him. Just pull yourself up and get going, he said. Don't fall behind. Finally we crossed a field full of pink and yellow wildflowers, and at the far end, where the path ended, was a lake. The surface was perfectly clear and placid and we could see ourselves. Here we are, Mr. Cheetam said. Skinny-dipping, Donny said. First things first, girls, Mr. Cheetam said, so we hopped to, setting up camp and scrounging enough wood for the night. Donny and I stripped naked and jumped off the cliffs. No one else was around but when we swam and shouted and splashed our voices bounced back and forth off the rocks. Ricochet, we yelled. We dove and dove. Then we lay on a hot flat rock. I noticed that Donny had hair on his balls and he probably noticed so did I. You want to smoke a stogerooni? Donny asked. Nah, later, I said. We were stretched out and quiet: blue sky, yellow sun, white mountain—everything was perfect but Donny got antsy doing nothing for so long and took another dip. He came up fast and said, A fish! I saw a fish! And he got his fishing pole and caught a rainbow, like pulling a prayer from the water. Good work, Donny, Mr. Cheetam said. The fish wasn't all the way dead yet and Mr. Cheetam had to slap its head against a rock. Blood came out the eyes. The knife blade sank into the skin with a ripping sound. What do we do with the guts? I asked. Toss 'em in the lake, Mr. Cheetam said. We don't want any animals coming into camp. Bears? Donny said. It's not impossible, Mr. Cheetam said, but not likely, either. Maybe the Sasquatch, Donny said. Mr. Cheetam said to shut up about that damned Sasquatch. It's time you grow up, he said, shaking Donny's arm. Jesus, Donny said, rubbing himself. Mr. Cheetam wrapped the fillets in foil and set them on the fire. It was soft out now, not dark but not light, either. Our shadows were weak around the fire, and Mt. Olympus was tinged pink and purple, and the wind died down. Hey, I said, what about the Quinault? Yeah, the Quinault! Donny said. You said I'd get to walk across it. Oh crap, what was I thinking? Mr. Cheetam asked himself. You already did and I forgot, God damn it! We ran back through the darkening wildflowers. We found a little stream about a foot wide and three inches deep that you would never think was a river but it was. There's your mighty Quinault, Donny, Mr. Cheetam said. Donny asked if we built a dam would the river dry up below and Mr. Cheetam laughed, saying, No, I'm afraid it doesn't work that way. We bent down and drank and splashed our faces in the water. We listened to the little river, trickling in a whisper. It was almost like nothing. The fish was all burned to hell when we got back to camp. Donny was upset and kept whining. I'm sorry, Mr. Cheetam said, but things happen. What can I say? Then he offered, Tomorrow? You want to stay another day? Donny looked at me, then said, Stay! Stay! O.K., Mr. Cheetam said, I think we've got everything we need—plenty of provisions—and we'll catch some more fish. After dinner, Mr. Cheetam drew out his flask again. His face was like my dad's had been in the last days, rough and black. One night toward the end I'd found him, my dad, in our broom closet. He had all his Bob Dylan records out and was writing new lyrics on them with a nail. Other things happened that I prefer to keep to myself. All week his loud voice was like the echo of thoughts he'd had a long time ago. Then one morning at the very end I heard him calling me in the rain. He was on top of our house in boxer shorts, yelling. Our neighbor tried to drive him off the roof by throwing a pot of geraniums at him. My dad started ripping apart the chimney and pitching bricks down on me and everybody else on the front lawn. We had to call the authorities. For a while he thought he was Jesus in a hospital called St. Judas, but it was really St. Jude's and my dad, of course, wasn't Jesus. The same people who took him to the hospital brought me to the Home. I hadn't eaten in three days. Nearby we saw field mice hopping around, and Mr. Cheetam said that we'd better keep our packs inside the tents tonight. He hooked his arm around Donny's neck and said, How'd you like to go to California? Not Eureka, Donny said. No, Mr. Cheetam said, L.A. Donny said he didn't know anything about L.A. Mr. Cheetam fussed with the fire, arranging the coals. When that goes out that's it until morning, he said. He tipped back the flask. Then he capped it and said, That's it for that, too. He stretched and groaned and walked out where the firelight failed. I heard him whistling in the dark. Son? Mr. Cheetam said. What? Donny asked. Come on over here a minute, Mr. Cheetam said. They were in the shadows. I heard Donny say, What does Mom think? That's the thing, Mr. Cheetam said. Your mother would stay. I don't know, Donny said. How long would we be gone? Donald, Mr. Cheetam said, don't be stupid. We're divorcing, your mom and I. You see, we won't come back—we'll live in a brand-new house there. Donny begged, But why? Donald, come on. You see how things are. The two of them were quiet and staring ahead, like their next thoughts might fall out of the sky. What can I say? Mr. Cheetam said. Nothing, Donny said. I love you, Donald. You know that. I crawled inside our tent. A little while later, Donny got in his bag, buried down inside. He was crying and choking. I whispered, Donny, hey, hey Donny? Donny? I think I hear something out there. Do you hear it? Let's go look! I hugged my arm around him and he started jerking in his bag and sat up and cried to me, Here's your stupid spatula! Then he crossed over into Mr. Cheetam's tent but kept crying and begging even louder for no divorce. Look, I heard Mr. Cheetam say, after your sister died— His voice fell apart. That's too easy, he said. I've met someone else. He was quiet a minute. That's the truth. I thought the crying would go on forever, but eventually Donny must have fallen asleep. I turned over and over in my sleeping bag, and then I put on Sister Celestine's scapular and grabbed the flashlight and crawled out of the tent. The fire made a hiss and I kicked the last few embers around in the bed of ash. Mr. Cheetam snorted in his sleep and I heard Donny say, Dad? and Mr. Cheetam say, What? but there was nothing after that, even though I stood outside their tent a long time, listening. I aimed my flashlight ahead to the flat rock rim of the lake and followed the narrow beam up there. I sat, dangling my feet, and snapped off the light. I think I was feeling sorry for myself. Suddenly it felt like we'd been gone for ages. Was it Sunday? I gathered up ten rocks for a rosary, to count my prayers. I rattled them in my hands and started the Our Father but my voice was weird. I shook the rocks in my fist like dice. I threw one in the lake, and a little while later I heard the splash. Circles opened out where the stone had vanished. I thought of saying something in Latin but couldn't recall a single word, except amen. I yelled out, A-men! and heard back, Hey-men, hey-men, hey-men, smaller and smaller. I stretched out on the rock. Sister Celestine's scapular was old, the wool worn soft from handling. Once, at the Home, I had climbed the stairs, six flights up from my room in the basement, to see where she lived. We weren't supposed to go up there. I saw why. Hosiery hung from the water pipes. Candy wrappers were crumpled on the floor. A black habit lay like an empty sack beside the bed. The bed was unmade, and I could see the hollow where Sister Celestine slept. A pale-green blanket and a thin yellow top sheet had been twisted into a tight braid and kicked off the end of the mattress. The only decoration was a black wooden crucifix, nailed on the wall above the bed like a permanent shadow. I was still lying there when Donny and Mr. Cheetam came running up the rock in their undies. Hey, what's going on? they asked. They said they'd heard me shouting and were afraid I'd got lost or seen something. Maybe the Sasquatch, Donny said. God damn it, Donald, there is no such thing, Mr. Cheetam said. That's just a myth. Oh yeah, Donny said. How do you know? Don't worry, I said. It was nothing. You sure? Donny said. It was nothing, I said. I'm sure. A wind was blowing and it was a little cold on that rock. Nobody knew what to say. See out there? Above Mt. Olympus? That green star? Mr. Cheetam said, pointing. We all looked—a vague white shadow, a green light. It's not really a star. That's a planet—that's Venus, Mr. Cheetam said. The goddess of love. That's just a myth, Donny said, looking at his father. Bastard. I didn't hear you, Mr. Cheetam said. What did you say? Nothing, Donny said. Nothing? It didn't sound like nothing to me. I pitched another rock in the lake, way out there, as far as possible. We all listened. Across the water a circle spread out, wider and wider. Then, shaking with cold, Donny folded his arms around himself and yelled out, Hey, and we heard back, Hey, hey, hey, and then I yelled out, Hey, and even Mr. Cheetam joined in, and we kept hearing back, Hey, hey, hey, like there were millions of us everywhere. ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

And then nightfall would fall and our facility would fill with the sounds of quiet fast breathing from inside our Privacy Tarps as we all experimented per the techniques taught us in “It’s Yours to Do With What You Like!” and what do you suspect, you had better make sure that that little gap between the main wall and the sliding wall that slides out to make your Gender Areas is like really really small. Which guess what, it wasn’t. That is all what I am saying. Also all what I am saying is, who could blame Josh for noting that gap and squeezing through it snakelike in just his Old Navy boxers that Old Navy gave us to wear for gratis, plus who could blame Ruthie for leaving her Velcro knowingly un-Velcroed? Which soon all the rest of us heard them doing what the rest of us so badly wanted to be doing, only we, being more mindful of the rules than them, just laid there doing the self-stuff from the video, listening to Ruth and Josh really doing it for real, which believe me, even that was pretty fun. And when Josh came back next morning so happy he was crying, that was a further blow to our morality, because why did our Coördinators not catch him on their supposedly nighttime monitors? In all of our hearts was the thought of, O.K., we thought you said no boy-and-girl stuff, and yet here is Josh, with his Old Navy boxers and a hickey on his waist, and none of you guys is even saying boo? Because I for one wanted to do right, I did not want to sneak through that gap, I wanted to wed someone when old enough (I will soon tell who) and relocate to the appropriate facility in terms of demographics, namely Young Marrieds, such as Scranton, PA, or Mobile, AL, and then along comes Josh doing Ruthie with imperity, and no one is punished, and soon the miracle of birth results and all our Coördinators, even Mr. Delacourt, are bringing Baby Amber stuffed animals? At which point every cell or chromosome or whatever it was in my gonads that had been holding their breaths was suddenly like, Dude, slide through that gap no matter how bad it hurts, squat outside Carolyn’s Privacy Tarp whispering, Carolyn, it’s me, please un-Velcro your Privacy opening! Then came the final straw that broke the back of my saying no to my gonads, which was I dreamed I was that black dude on MTV’s “Hot and Spicy Christmas” (around like Location Indicator 34412, if you want to check it out) and Carolyn was the oiled-up white chick, and we were trying to earn the Island Vacation by miming through the ten Hot ‘n’ Nasty Positions before the end of “We Three Kings,” only then, sadly, during Her on Top, Thumb in Mouth, her Elf Cap fell off, and as the Loser Buzzer sounded she bent low to me, saying, Oh, Jon, I wish we did not have to do this for fake in front of hundreds of kids on Spring Break doing the wave but instead could do it for real with just each other in private. And then she kissed me with a kiss I can only describe as melting. So imagine that is you, you are a healthy young dude who has been self-practicing all those months, and you wake from that dream of a hot chick giving you a melting kiss, and that same hot chick is laying or lying just on the other side of the sliding wall, and meanwhile in the very next Privacy Tarp is that sleeping dude Josh, who a few weeks before a baby was born to the girl he had recently did it with, and nothing bad happened to them, except now Mr. Slippen sometimes let them sleep in. What would you do? Well, you would do what I did, you would slip through, and when Carolyn un-Velcroed that Velcro wearing her blue Guess kimono, whispering, Oh my God, I thought you’d never ask, that would be the most romantic thing you had ever underwent. And though I had many times seen LI 34321 for Honey Grahams, where the stream of milk and the stream of honey enjoin to make that river of sweet-tasting goodness, I did not know that, upon making love, one person may become like the milk and the other like the honey, and soon they cannot even remember who started out the milk and who the honey, they just become one fluid, this like honey/milk combo. Well, that is what happened to us. Which is why soon I had to go to Mr. Slippen hat in hand and say, Sir, Baby Amber will be having a little playmate if that is O.K. with you, to which he just rolled his eyes and crushed the plastic cup in his hand and threw it at my chest, saying, What are we running in here, Randy, a freaking play school? Then he said, Well, Christ, what am I supposed to do, lose two valuable team members because of this silliness? All right all right, how soon will Baby Amber be out of that crib or do I have to order your kid a whole new one? Which I was so happy, because soon I would be a father and would not even lose my job. A few days later, like how it was with Ruthie and Josh, Mr. Delacourt’s brother the minister came in and married us, and afterward barbecue beef was catered, and we danced at our window while outside pink and purple balloons were released, and all the other kids were like, Rock on, you guys, have a nice baby and all! It was the best day of our lifes thus far for sure. But I guess it is true what they say at LI 11006 about life throwing us not only curves and sliders but sometimes even worse, as Dodger pitcher Hector Jones throws from behind his back a grand piano for Allstate, because soon here came that incident with Baby Amber, which made everybody just loony. Which that incident was, Baby Amber died. Sometimes it was just nice and gave one a fresh springtime feeling to sit in the much coveted window seat, finalizing one’s Summary while gazing out at our foliage strip, which sometimes slinking through it would be a cat from Rustic Village Apartments, looking so cute that one wished to pet or even smell it, with wishful petting being the feeling I was undergoing on the sad day of which I am telling, such as even giving the cat a tuna chunk and a sip of my Diet Coke! If cats even like soda. That I do not know. And then Baby Amber toddled by, making this funny noise in her throat of not being very happy, and upon reaching the Snack Cart she like seized up and tumped over, giving off this sort of shriek. At first we all just looked at her, like going, Baby Amber, if that is some sort of new game, we do not exactly get it, plus come on, we have a lot of Assessments to get through this morning, such as a First-Taste Session for Diet GingerCoke, plus a very critical First View of Dean Witter’s Preliminary Clip Reel for their campaign of “Whose Ass Are You Kicking Today?” But then she did not get up. We dropped our Summaries and raced to the Observation Window and began pounding, due to we loved her so much, her being the first baby we had ever witnessed living day after day, and soon the paramedics came and took her away, with one of them saying, Jesus, how stupid are you kids, anyway, this baby is burning up, she is like 107 with meningitis. So next morning there was Carolyn all freaked out with her little baby belly, watching Amber’s crib being dismantled by Physical Plant, who wiped all facility surfaces with Handi Wipes in case the meningitis was viral, and there was the rest of us, just like thrashing around the place kicking things down, going like, This sucks, this is totally fucked up! Looking back, I commend Mr. Slippen for what he did next, which was he said, Christ, folks, all our hearts are broken, it is not just yours, do you or do you not think I have Observed this baby from the time she was born, do you or do you not think that I, too, feel like kicking things down while shouting, This sucks, this is totally fucked up? Only what would that accomplish, would that bring Baby Amber back? I am at a loss, in terms of how can we best support Ruth and Josh in this sad tragic time, is it via feeling blue and cranky, or via feeling refreshed and hopeful and thus better able to respond to their needs? So that was a non-brainer, and we all voted to accept Mr. Slippen’s Facility Morale Initiative, and soon were getting our Aurabon® twice a day instead of once, plus it seemed like better stuff, and I for one had never felt so glad or stress-free, and my Assessments became very nuanced, and I spent many hours doing and enjoying them and then redoing and reënjoying them, and it was during this period that we won the McDorland Prize for Excellence in Assessing in the Midwest Region in our demographic category of White Teens. The only one who failed to become gladder was Carolyn, who due to her condition of pregnant could not join us at the place in the wall where we hooked in for our Aurabon®. And now whenever the rest of us hooked in she would come over and say such negative things as, Wake up and smell the coffee, you feel bad because a baby died, how about honoring that by continuing to feel bad, which is only natural, because a goddam baby died, you guys? At night in our shared double Privacy Tarp in Conference Room 11, which our Coördinators had gave us so we would feel more married, I would be like, Honey, look, your attitude only sucks because you can’t hook in, once baby comes all will be fine, due to you’ll be able to hook in again, right? But she always blew me off, like she would say she was thinking of never hooking in again and why was I always pushing her to hook in and she just didn’t know who to trust anymore, and one night when the baby kicked she said to her abdomen, Don’t worry, angel, Mommy is going to get you Out. Which my feeling was: Out? Hello? My feeling was: Hold on, I like what I have achieved, and when I thought of descending Out to somewhere with no hope of meeting luminaries such as actress Lily Farrell-Garesh or Mark Belay, chairperson of Thatscool.com, descending Out to, say, some lumberyard like at LI 77656 for Midol, merely piling lumber as cars rushed past, cars with no luminaries inside, only plain regular people who did not know me from Adam, who, upon seeing me, saw just some mere guy stacking lumber having such humdrum thoughts as thinking, Hey, I wonder what’s for lunch, duh—I got a cold flat feeling in my gut, because I did not want to undergo it. Plus furthermore (and I said this to Carolyn) what will it be like for us when all has been taken from us? Of what will we speak of? I do not want to only speak of my love in grunts! If I wish to compare my love to a love I have previous knowledge of, I do not want to stand there in the wind casting about for my metaphor! If I want to say like, Carolyn, remember that RE/MAX one where as the redhead kid falls asleep holding that Teddy bear rescued from the trash, the bear comes alive and winks, and the announcer goes, Home is the place where you find yourself suddenly no longer longing for home (LI 34451)—if I want to say to Carolyn, Carolyn, LI 34451, check it out, that is how I feel about you—well, then, I want to say it! I want to possess all the articulate I can, because otherwise there we will be, in non-designer clothes, no longer even on TrendSetters & TasteMakers gum cards with our photos on them, and I will turn to her and say, Honey, uh, honey, there is a certain feeling but I cannot name it and cannot cite a precedent-type feeling, but trust me, dearest, wow, do I ever feel it for you, right now. And what will that be like, that stupid standing there, just a man and a woman and the wind, and nobody knowing what nobody is meaning? Just then the baby kicked my hand, which at that time was on Carolyn’s stomach. And Carolyn was like, You are either with me or agin me. Which was so funny, because she was proving my point! Because you are either with me or agin me is what the Lysol bottle at LI 12009 says to the scrubbing sponge as they approach the grease stain together, which is making at them a threatening fist while wearing a sort of Mexican bandolera! When I pointed this out, she removed my hand from her belly. I love you, I said. Prove it, she said. So next day Carolyn and I came up to Mr. Slippen and said, Please, Mr. Slippen, we hereby Request that you supply us with the appropriate Exit Paperwork. To which Mr. Slippen said, Guys, folks, tell me this is a joke by you on me. And Carolyn said softly, because she had always liked Mr. Slippen, who had taught her to ride a bike when small in the Fitness Area, It’s no joke. And Slippen said, Holy smokes, you guys are possessed of the fruits of the labors of hundreds of thousands of talented passionate men and women, some of whom are now gone from us, they poured forth these visions in the prime of their lives, reacting spontaneously to the beauty and energy of the world around them, which is why these stories and images are such an unforgettable testimony to who we are as a nation! And you have it all within you! I can only imagine how thrilling that must be. And now, to give it all up? For what? Carolyn, for what? And Carolyn said, Mr. Slippen, I did not see you raising your babies in such a confined environment. And Slippen said, Carolyn, that is so, but also please note that neither I nor my kids have ever been on TrendSetters & TasteMakers gum cards and believe me, I have heard a few earfuls vis-à-vis that, as in: Dad, you could’ve got us In but no, and now, Dad, I am merely another ophthalmologist among millions of ophthalmologists. And please do not think that is not something that a father sometimes struggles with. In terms of coulda shoulda woulda. And Carolyn said, Jon, you know what, he is not even really listening to us. And Slippen said, Randy, since when is your name Jon? Because by the way my name is really Jon. Randy is just what my mother put on the form the day I was Accepted, although tell the truth I do not know why. It is one thing to see all this stuff in your head, Carolyn said. But altogether different to be out in it, I would expect. And I could see that she was softening into a like daughter role, as if wanting him to tell her what to do, and up came LI 27493 (Prudential Life), where, with Dad enstroked in the hospital bed, Daughter asks should she marry the guy who though poor has a good heart, and we see the guy working with inner-city kids via spray-painting a swing set, and Dad says, Sweetie, the heart must lead you. And then later here is Dad all better in a tux, and Daughter hugging the poor but good dude while sneaking a wink at Dad, who raises his glass and points at the groom’s shoe, where there is this little smudge of swing-set paint. I cannot comment as to that, Slippen said. Everyone is different. Nobody can know someone else’s experiences. Larry, no offense but you are talking shit, Carolyn said. We deserve better than that from you. And Slippen looked to be softening, and I remembered when he would sneak all of us kids in doughnuts, doughnuts we did not even need to Assess but could simply eat with joy with jelly on our face before returning to our Focussed Purposeful Play with toys we would Assess by coloring in on a sheet of paper either a smiling duck if the toy was fun or a scowling duck if the toy bit. And Slippen said, Look, Carolyn, you are two very fortunate people, even chosen people. A huge investment was made in you, which I would argue you have a certain responsibility to repay, not to mention, with a baby on the way, there is the question of security, security for your future that I— Uncle, please, Carolyn said, which was her trumpet cart, because when she was small he had let her call him that and now she sometimes still did when the moment was right, such as at Christmas Eve when all of our feelings was high. Jesus, Slippen said. Look, you two can do what you want, clearly. I cannot stop you kids, but, golly, I wish I could. All that is required is the required pre-Exit visit to the Lerner Center, which as you know you must take before I can give you the necessary Exit Paperwork. When would you like to take or make that visit? Now, Carolyn said. Gosh, Carolyn, when did you become such a pistol? Mr. Slippen said, and called for the minivan. The Lerner Center, even when reached via a blackened-window minivan, is a trip that will really blow one’s mind, due to all the new sights and sounds one experiences, such as carpet on floor is different from carpet on facility floor, such as smoke smell from the minivan ashtrays, whereas we are a No Smoking facility, not to mention, wow, when we were led in blindfolded for our own protection, so many new smells shot forth from these like sidewalkside blooms or whatever that Carolyn and I were literally bumping into each other like swooning. Inside they took our blindfolds off, and, yes, it looked and smelled exactly like our facility, and like every facility across the land, via the PervaScent® system, except in other facilities across the land a lady in blue scrubs does not come up to you with crossed eyes, sloshing around a cup of lemonade, saying in this drunk voice like, A barn is more than a barn it is a memory of a time when you were cared for by a national chain of caregivers who bring you the best of life with a selfless evening in Monterey when the stars are low you can be thankful to your Amorino Co broker! And then she burst into tears and held her lemonade so crooked it was like spilling on the Foosball table. I had no idea what Location Indicator or Indicators she was even at, and when I asked, she didn’t seem to even know what I meant by Location Indicator, and was like, Oh, I just don’t know anymore what is going on with me or why I would expose that tenderest part of my baby to the roughest part of the forest where the going gets rough, which is not the accomplishment of any one man but an entire team of dreamers who dream the same dreams you dream in the best interests of that most important system of all, your family! Then this Lerner Center dude came over and led her away, and she slammed her hand down so hard on the Foosball table that the little goalie cracked and his head flew over by us, and someone said, Good one, Doreen. Now there’s no Foosball. At which time luckily it was time for our Individual Consultation. Who we got was this Mid-Ager from Akron, OH, who, when I asked my first question off of my Question Card they gave us, which was, What is it like in terms of pain, he said, There is no pain except once I poked myself in my hole with a coffee stirrer and, Jesus, that smarted, but otherwise you can’t really even feel it. So I was glad to hear it, although not so glad when he showed us where he had poked his hole with the stirrer, because I am famous as a wimp among my peers in terms of gore, and he had opted not to use any DermaFill®, and you could see right in. And, wow, there is something about observing up close a raw bloody hole at the base of somebody’s hair that really gets one thinking. And though he said, in Question No. 2, that his hole did not present him any special challenges in terms of daily maintenance, looking into that hole, I was like, Dude, how does that give you no challenges, it is like somebody blew off a firecracker inside your freaking neck! And when Carolyn said Question No. 3, which was, How do you now find your thought processes, his brow darkened and he said, Well, to be frank, though quite advanced, having been here three years, there are, if you will, places where things used to be when I went looking for them, brainwise, but now, when I go there, nothing is there, it is like I have the shelving but not the cans of corn, if you get my drift. For example, looking at you, young lady, I know enough to say you are pretty, but when I direct my brain to a certain place, to find there a more vivid way of saying you are pretty, watch this, some words will come out, which I, please excuse me, oh dammit— Then his voice changed to this announcer voice and he was like, These women know that for many generations entrenched deep in this ancient forest is a secret known by coffeegrowers since the dawn of time man has wanted one thing which is to watch golf in peace will surely follow once knowledge is dispersed and the World Book is a super bridge across the many miles the phone card can close the gap! And his eyes were crossing and he was sputtering, which would have been funny if we did not know that soon our eyes would be the crossing eyes and out of our mouths would the sputter be flying. Then he got up and fled from the room, hitting himself hard in the face. And I said to Carolyn, Well, that about does it for me. And I waited for her to say that about did it for her, but she only sat there looking conflicted with her hand on her belly. Out in the Common Room, I took her in my arms and said, Honey, I do not really think we have it all that bad, why not just go home and love each other and our baby when he or she comes, and make the best of all the blessings what we have been given? And her head was tilted down in this way that seemed to be saying, Yes, sweetie, my God, you were right all along. But then a bad decisive thing happened, which was this old lady came hobbling over and said, Dear, you must wait until Year Two to truly know, some do not thrive but others do, I am Year Two, and do you know what? When I see a bug now, I truly see a bug, when I see a paint chip I am truly seeing that paint chip, there is no distraction and it is so sweet, nothing in one’s field of vision but what one opts to put there via moving one’s eyes, and also do you hear how well I am speaking? Out in the minivan I said, Well I am decided, and Carolyn said, Well I am too. And then there was this long dead silence, because I knew and she knew that what we had both decided was not the same decision, not at all, that old crony had somehow rung her bell! And I said, How do you know what she said is even true? And she said, I just know. That night in our double Privacy Tarp, Carolyn nudged me awake and said, Jon, doesn’t it make sense to make our mistakes in the direction of giving our kid the best possible chance at a beautiful life? And I was like, Chick, please take a look in the Fridge, where there is every type of food that must be kept cold, take a look on top of the Fridge, where there is every type of snack, take a look in our Group Closet, which is packed with gratis designerwear such as Baby Gap and even Baby Ann Taylor, whereas what kind of beautiful life are you proposing with a Fridge that is empty both inside and on top, and the three of us going around all sloppenly, because I don’t know about you but my skill set is pretty limited in terms of what do I know how to do, and if you go into the Fashion Module for Baby Ann Taylor and click with your blinking eyes on Pricing Info you will find that they are not just giving that shit away. And she said, Oh, Jon, you break my heart, that night when you came to my Tarp you were like a lion taking what he wanted but now you are like some bunny wiffling his nose in fright. Well, that wasn’t nice, and I told her that wasn’t nice, and she said, Jesus, don’t whine, you are whining like a bunny, and I said I would rather be a bunny than a rag, and she said maybe I better go sleep somewhere else. So I went out to Boys and slept on the floor, it being too late to check out a Privacy Tarp. And I was pissed and sad, because no dude likes to think of himself as a rabbit, because once your girl thinks of you as a rabbit, how will she ever again think of you as a lion? And all of the sudden I felt very much like starting over with someone who would always think of me as a lion and never as a rabbit, and who really got it about how lucky we were. Laying there in Boys, I did what I always did when confused, which was call up my Memory Loop of my mom, where she is baking a pie with her red hair up in a bun, and as always she paused in her rolling and said, Oh, my little man, I love you so much, which is why I did the most difficult thing of all, which was part with you, my darling, so that you could use your exceptional intelligence to do that most holy of things, help other people. Stay where you are, do not get distracted, have a content and productive life, and I will be happy too. Blinking on End, I was like, Thanks, Mom, you have always been there for me, I really wish I could have met you in person before you died. In the morning Slippen woke me by giving me the light shock on the foot bottom which was sometimes useful to help us arise if we had to arise early and were in need of assistance, and said to please accompany him, as we had a bit of a sticky wicket in our purview. Waiting in Conference Room 6 were Mr. Dove and Mr. Andrews and Mr. Delacourt himself, and at the end of the table Carolyn, looking small, with both hands on her pile of Exit Paperwork and her hair in braids, which I had always found cute, her being like that milkmaid for Swiss Rain Chocolate (LI 10003), who suddenly throws away her pail and grows sexy via taking out her braids, and as some fat farm ladies line up by a silo and also take out their braids to look sexy, their thin husbands look dubious and run for the forest. Randy, Mr. Dove said, Carolyn here has evinced a desire to Exit. What we would like to know is, being married, do you have that same desire? And I looked at Carolyn like, You are jumping to some conclusion because of one little fight, when it was you who called me the rabbit first, which is the only reason I called you rag? It’s not because of last night, Jon, Carolyn said. Randy, I sense some doubt? Mr. Dove said. And I had to admit that some doubt was being felt by me, because it seemed more than ever like she was some sort of malcontentish girl who would never be happy, no matter how good things were. Maybe you kids would like some additional time, Mr. Andrews said. Some time to talk it over and be really sure. I don’t need any additional time, Carolyn said. And I said, You’re going no matter what? No matter what I do? And she said, Jon, I want you to come with me so bad, but, yes, I’m going. And Mr. Dove said, Wait a minute, who is Jon? And Mr. Andrews said, Randy is Jon, it is apparently some sort of pet name between them. And Slippen said to us, Look, guys, I have been married for nearly thirty years and it has been my experience that, when in doubt, take a breath. Err on the side of being together. Maybe, Carolyn, the thing to do is, I mean, your Paperwork is complete, we will hold on to it, and maybe Randy, as a concession to Carolyn, you could complete your Paperwork, and we’ll hold on to it for you, and when you both decide the time is right, all you have to do is say the word and we will— I’m going today, Carolyn said. As soon as possible. And Mr. Dove looked at me and said, Jon, Randy, whoever, are you prepared to go today? And I said no. Because what is her rush, I was feeling, why is she looking so frantic with furrowed anxious brow like that Claymation chicken at LI 98473, who says the sky is falling the sky is falling and turns out it is only a Dodge Ramcharger, which crushes her from on high and one arm of hers or wing sticks out with a sign that says March Madness Daze? And Slippen said, Guys, guys, I find this a great pity. You are terrific together. A real love match. Carolyn was crying now and said, I am so sorry, but if I wait I might change my mind, which I know in my heart would be wrong. And she thrust her Exit Paperwork across at Mr. Slippen. Then Dove and Andrews and Delacourt began moving with great speed, as if working directly from some sort of corporate manual, which actually they were, Mr. Dove had some photocopied sheets, and, reading from the sheets, he asked was there anyone with whom she wished to have a fond last private conversation, and she said, Well, duh, and we were both left briefly alone. She took a deep breath while looking at me all tender and said, Oh Gadzooks. Which that broke my heart, Gadzooks being what we sometimes said at nice privacy moments in our Privacy Tarp when overwhelmed by our good luck in terms of our respective bodies looking so hot and appropriate, Gadzooks being from LI 38492 for Zookers Gum, where the guy blows a bubble so Zookified that it ingests a whole city and the city goes floating up to Mars. At this point her tears were streaming down and mine also, because up until then I thought we had been so happy. Jon, please, she said. I just can’t, I said. And that was true. So we sat there quiet with her hands against my hands like Colonel Sanders and wife at LI 87345, where he is in jail for refusing to give up the recipe for KFC Haitian MiniBreasts, and then Carolyn said, I didn’t mean that thing about the rabbit, and I scrinkled up my nose rabbitlike to make her laugh. But apparently in the corporate manual there is a time limit on fond last private conversations, because in came Kyle and Blake from Security, and Carolyn kissed me hard, like trying to memorize my mouth, and whispered, Someday come find us. Then they took her away, or she took them away rather, because she was so far in front they had to like run to keep up as she clomped loudly away in her Kenneth Cole boots, which by the way they did not let her keep those, because that night, selecting my pajamas, I found them back in the Group Closet. Night after night after that I would lay or lie alone in our Privacy Tarp, which now held only her nail clippers and her former stuffed dog Lefty, and during the days Slippen let me spend many unbillable hours in the much coveted window seat, just scanning some images or multiscanning some images, and around me would be the other facility Boys and Girls, all Assessing, all smiling, because we were still on the twice-a-day Aurabon®, and thinking of Carolyn in those blue scrubs, alone in the Lerner Center, I would apply for some additional Aurabon® via filling out a Work-Affecting Mood-Problem Notification, which Slippen would always approve, because he felt so bad for me. And the Aurabon® would make things better, as Aurabon® always makes things better, although soon what I found was, when you are hooking in like eight or nine times a day, you are always so happy, and yet it is a kind of happy like chewing on tinfoil, and once you are living for that sort of happy, you soon cannot be happy enough, even when you are very very happy and are even near tears due to the beauty of the round metal hooks used to hang your facility curtains, you feel this intense wish to be even happier, so you tear yourself away from the beautiful curtain hooks, and with shaking happy hands fill out another Work-Affecting Mood-Problem Notification, and then, because nothing in your facility is beautiful enough to look at with your new level of happiness, you sit in the much coveted window seat and start lendelling in this crazy uncontrolled way, calling up, say, the Nike one with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon (LI 89736), and though it is beautiful, it is not beautiful enough, so you scatter around some Delicate Secrets lingerie models from LI 22314, and hang fat Dole oranges and bananas in the trees (LI 76765), and add like a sky full of bright stars from LI 74638 for Crest, and from the Smell Palate supplied by the anti-allergen Capaviv® you fill the air with jasmine and myrrh, but still that is not beautiful enough, so you blink on End and fill out another Work-Affecting Mood-Problem Notification, until finally one day Mr. Dove comes over and says, Randy, Jon, whatever you are calling yourself these days—a couple of items. First, it seems to us that you are in some private space not helpful to you, and so we are cutting back your Aurabon® to twice a day like the other folks, and please do not sit in that window seat anymore, it is hereby forbidden to you, and plus we are going to put you on some additional Project Teams, since it is our view that idle hands are the devil’s work area. Also, since you are only one person, it is not fair, we feel, for you to have a whole double Privacy Tarp to yourself, you must, it seems to us, rejoin your fellow Boys in Boys. So that night I went back with Rudy and Lance and Jason and the others, and they were nice, as they are always nice, and via No. 10 cable Jason shared with me some Still Photos from last year’s Christmas party, of Carolyn hugging me from behind with her cute face appearing beneath my armpit, which made me remember how after the party in our Privacy Tarp we played a certain game, which it is none of your beeswax who I was in that game and who she was, only, believe me, that was a memorable night, with us watching the snow fall from the much coveted window seat, in which we sat snuggling around midnight, when we had left our Tarp to take a break for air, and also we were both sort of sore. Which made it all that much more messed up and sad to be sleeping once again alone in Boys. When the sliding wall came out to make our Gender Areas, I noticed that they had fixed it so nobody could slide through anymore, via five metal rods. All we could do was, by putting our mouths to the former gap, say good night to the Girls, who all said good night back from their respective Privacy Tarps in this sort of muffled way. But I did not do that, as I had nobody over there I wished to say good night to, they all being like merely sisters to me, and that was all. So that was the saddest time of my life thus far for sure. Then one day we were all laying or lying on our stomachs playing Hungarian Headchopper for GameBoy, a new proposed one where you are this dude with a scythe in your mother’s garden, only what your mother grows is heads, when suddenly a shadow was cast over my game by Mr. Slippen, which freaked up my display, and I harvested three unripe heads, but the reason Mr. Slippen was casting his shadow was, he had got a letter for me from Carolyn! And I was so nervous opening it, and even more nervous after opening it, because inside were these weird like marks I could not read, like someone had hooked a pen to the back leg of a bird and said, Run, little bird, run around this page and I will mail it for you. And the parts I could read were bumming me out even worse, such as she had wrote all sloppenly, Jon a abbot is a cove, a glen, it is something with prayerful guys all the livelong day in silence as they move around they are sure of one thing which is the long-term stability of a product we not only stand behind we run behind since what is wrong with taking a chance even if that chance has horns and hoofs and it is just you and your worst fear in front of ten thousand screaming supporters of your last chance to be the very best you can be? And then thank God it started again looking like the pen on the foot of the running bird. I thought of how hot and smart she had looked when doing a crossword with sunglasses on her head in Hilfiger cutoffs, I thought of her that first night in her Privacy Tarp, naked except for her La Perla panties in the light that came from the Exit sign through the thin blue Privacy Tarp, so her flat tummy and not-flat breasts and flirty smile were all blue, and then all of the sudden I felt like the biggest jerk in the world, because why had I let her go? It was like I was all of the sudden waking up! She was mine and I was hers, she was so thin and cute, and now she was at the Lerner Center all alone? Shaking and scared with a bloody hole in her neck and our baby in her belly, hanging out with all those other scared shaking people with bloody holes in their necks, only none of them knew her and loved her like I did? I had done such a dumb-shit thing to her, all the time thinking it was sound reasoning, because isn’t that how it is with our heads, when we are in them it always makes sense, but then later, when you look back, we sometimes are like, I am acting like a total dumb-ass! Then Brad came up and was like, Dude, time to hook in. And I was like, Please, Brad, do not bother me with that shit at this time. And I went to get Slippen, only he was at lunch, so I went to get Dove and said, Sir, I hereby Request my appropriate Exit Paperwork. And he said, Randy, please, you’re scaring me, don’t act rash, have a look out the window. I had a look, and tell the truth it did not look that good, such as the Rustic Village Apartments, out of which every morning these bummed-out-looking guys in the plainest non-designer clothes ever would trudge out and get in their junky cars. And was someone joyfully kissing them goodbye, like saying when you come home tonight you will get a big treat, which is me? No, the person who should have been kissing them with joy was yelling, or smoking, or yelling while smoking, and when the dudes came home they would sit on their stoops with heads in hand, as if all day long at work someone had been pounding them with clubs on their heads, saying they were jerks. Then Dove said, Randy, Randy, why would a talented young person like yourself wish to surrender his influence in the world and become just another lowing cattle in the crowd, don’t you know how much people out there look up to you and depend on you? And that was true. Because sometimes kids from Rustic Village would come over and stand in our lava rocks with our Tastemakers & Trendsetters gum cards upheld, pressing them to our window, and when we would wave to them or strike the pose we were posing on our gum cards, they would race back all happy to their crappy apartments, probably to tell their moms that they had seen the real actual us, which was probably like the high point of their weeks. But still, when I thought of those birdlike markings of Carolyn’s letter, I don’t know, something just popped, I felt I was at a distinct tilt, and I blurted out, No, no, just please bring me the freaking Paperwork, I am Requesting, and I thought when I Requested you had to do it! And Dove said sadly, We do, Randy, when you Request, we have to do it. Dove called the other Coördinators over and said, Larry, your little pal has just Requested his Paperwork. And Slippen said, I’ll be damned. What a waste, Delacourt said. This is one super kid. One of our best, Andrews said. Which was true, with me five times winning the Coöperative Spirit Award and once even the Denny O’Malley Prize, Denny O’Malley being this Assessor in Chicago, IL, struck down at age ten, who died with a smile on his face of leukemia. Say what you will, it takes courage, Slippen said. Going after one’s wife and all. Yes and no, Delacourt said. If you, Larry, fall off a roof, does it help me to go tumbling after you? But I am not your wife, Slippen said. Your pregnant wife. Wife or no, pregnant or no, Delacourt said. What we then have are two folks not feeling so good in terms of that pavement rushing up. No one is helped. Two are crushed. In effect three are crushed. Baby makes three, Andrews said. Although anything is possible, Slippen said. You know, the two of them together, the three of them, maybe they could make a go of it— Larry, whose side are you on? Dove said. I am on all sides, Slippen said. You see this thing from various perspectives, Andrews said. Anyway, this is academic, Delacourt said. He has Requested his Paperwork and we must provide it. His poor mother, Dove said. The sacrifices she made, and now this. Oh, please, Slippen said. His mother. Larry, sorry, did you say something? Dove said. Which mother did he get? Slippen said. Larry, please go to that Taste-and-Rate in Conference Room 6, Delacourt said. See how they are doing with those CheezWands. Which mother did we give him? Slippen said. The redhead baking the pie? The blonde in the garden? Larry, honestly, Dove said. Are you freaking out? The brunette at prayer? Slippen said. Who, putting down her prayer book, says, Stay where you are, do not get distracted, have a content and productive life, and I will be happy too? Larry has been working too hard, Andrews said. Plus taking prescription pills not prescribed to him, Delacourt said. I have just had it with all of this, Slippen said, and stomped off to the Observation Room. Ha ha, that Larry! Dove said. He did not even know your mom, Randy. Only we did, Andrews said. Very nice lady, Delacourt said. Made terrific pies, Dove said. And I was like, Do you guys think I am that stupid, I know something is up, because how did Slippen know my mom was a redhead making a pie and how did he know her exact words she said to me on my private Memory Loop? Then there was this long silence. And Delacourt said, Randy, when you were a child, you thought as a child. Do you know that one? And I did know that one, it being LI 88643 for Trojan Ribbed. Well, you are not a child anymore, he said. You are a man. A man in the middle of making a huge mistake. We had hoped it would not come to this, Dove said. Please accompany us to the Facility Cinema, Delacourt said. So I accompanied them to the Facility Cinema, which was a room off of Dining, with big-screen plasma TV and Pottery Barn leather couch and de-luxe Orville Redenbacher Corn Magician. Up on the big-screen came this old-fashioned-looking film of a plain young girl with stringy hair, smoking a cigarette in a house that looked pretty bad. And this guy unseen on the video said, O.K., tell us precisely why, in your own words. And the girl said, Oh, I dunno, due to my relation with the dad, I got less than great baby interest? O.K., the unseen voice said. And the money is not part? Well, sure, yeah, I can always use money, she said. But it is not the prime reason? the voice said. It being required that it not be the prime reason, but rather the prime reason might be, for example, your desire for a better life for your child? O.K., she said. Then they pulled back and you could see bashed-out windows with cardboard in them and the counters covered with dirty dishes and in the yard a car up on blocks. And you have no objections to the terms and conditions? the voice said. Which you have read in their entirety? It’s all fine, the girl said. Have you read it? the voice said. I read in it, she said. O.K., O.K., I read it cover to freaking cover. And the name change you have no objection to? the voice said. O.K., she said. Although why Randy? And the No-Visit Clause you also have no objection to? the voice said. Fine, she said, and took a big drag. Then Dove tapped on the wall twice and the movie Paused. Do you know who that lady is, Randy? he said. No, I said. Do you know that lady is your mom? he said. No, I said. Well, that lady is your mom, Randy, he said. We are sorry you had to learn it in this manner. And I was like, Very funny, that is not my mom, my mom is pretty, with red hair in a bun. Randy, we admit it, Delacourt said. We gave some of you stylized mothers, in your Memory Loops, for your own good, not wanting you to feel bad about who your real mothers were. But in this time of crisis we must give you the straight skinny. That is your real mother, Randy, that is your real former house, that is where you would have been raised had your mother not answered our ad all those years ago, that is who you are. So much in us is hardwired! You cannot fight fate without some significant help from an intervening entity, such as us, such as our resources, which we have poured into you in good faith all these years. You are a prince, we have made you a prince. Please do not descend back into the mud. Reconsider, Randy, Dove said. Sleep on it. Will you? Delacourt said. Will you at least sleep on it? And I said I would. Because tell the truth that thing with my mom had freaked me out, it was like my foundation had fallen away, like at LI 83743 for Advil, where the guy’s foundation of his house falls away and he thunks his head on the floor of Hell and thus needs a Advil, which the Devil has some but won’t give him any. As he left, Dove unhit Pause, and I had time to note many things on that video, such as that lady’s teeth were not good, such as my chin and hers were similar, such as she referred to our dog as Shit Machine, which what kind of name was that for a dog, such as at one point they zoomed in on this little baby sitting on the floor in just a diaper, all dirty and looking sort of dumb, and I could see very plain it was me. Just before Dinner, Dove came back in. Randy, your Paperwork, per your Request, he said. Do you still want it? I don’t know, I said. I’m not sure. You are making me very happy, Dove said. And he sent in Tony from Catering with this intense Dinner of steak au poivre and our usual cheese tray with Alsatian olives, and a milkshake in my monogrammed cup, and while I watched “Sunset Terror Home” on the big-screen, always a favorite, Bedtime passed and nobody came and got me, them letting me stay up as late as I wanted. Later that night in my Privacy Tarp I was wakened by someone crawling in, and, hitting my Abercrombie & Fitch night-light, I saw it was Slippen. Randy, I am so sorry for my part in all of this, he whispered. I just want to say you are a great kid and always have been since Day One and in truth I at times have felt you were more of a son than my own personal sons, and likewise with Carolyn, who was the daughter I never had. I did not know what to say to that, it being so personal and all, plus he was like laying or lying practically right on top of me and I could smell wine on his breath. We had always learned in Religion that if something is making you uncomfortable you should just say it, so I just said it, I said, Sir, this is making me uncomfortable. You know what is making me uncomfortable? he said. You lying here while poor Carolyn sits in the Lerner Center all alone, big as a house, scared to death. Randy, one only has one heart, and when that heart is breaking via thinking of what is in store for poor Carolyn, one can hardly be blamed for stepping in, can one? Can one? Randy, do you trust me? He had always been good to me, having taught me so much, like how to hit a Wiffle and how to do a pushup, and once had even brought in this trough and taught me and Ed and Josh to fish, and how fun was that, all of us laughing and feeling around on the floor for the fish we kept dropping during those moments of involuntary blindness that would occur as various fish-related LIs flashed in our heads, like the talking whale for Stouffer’s FishMeals (LI 38322), like the fish and loafs Jesus makes at LI 83722 and then that one dude goes, Lord, this bread is dry, can you not summon up some ButterSub? I trust you, I said. Then come on, he said, and crawled out of my Privacy Tarp. We crossed the Common Area and went past Catering, which I had never been that far before, and soon were standing in front of this door labelled Caution Do Not Open Without Facility Personnel Accompaniment. Randy, do you know what is behind this door? Slippen said. No, I said. Take a look, he said. And smiling a smile like that mother on Christmas morning at LI 98732 for Madpets.com, who throws off the tablecloth to reveal a real horse in their living room chewing on the rug, Slippen threw open that door. Looking out, I saw no walls and no rug and no ceiling, only lawn and flowers, and above that a wide black sky with stars, which all of that made me a little dizzy, there being no glass between me and it. Then Slippen very gently pushed me out. And I don’t know, it is one thing to look out a window, but when you are Out, actually Out, that is something very powerful, and how embarrassing was that, because I could not help it, I went down flat on my gut, checking out those flowers, and the feeling of the one I chose was like the silk on that Hermès jacket I could never seem to get Reserved because Vance was always hogging it, except the flower was even better, it being very smooth and built in like layers? With the outside layer being yellow, and inside that a white thing like a bell, and inside the white bell-like thing were fifteen (I counted) smaller bell-like red things, and inside each red thing was an even smaller orange two-dingly-thing combo. Which I was like, Dude, who thought this shit up? And though I knew very well from Religion it was God, still I had never thought so high of God as I did just then, seeing the kind of stuff He could do when He put His or Her mind to it. Also amazing was, laying there on my gut, I was able to observe very slowly some grass, on a blade basis! And what I found was, each blade is its total own blade, they are not all exact copies as I had always thought when looking at the Rustic Village Apartment lawn from the much coveted window seat, no, each blade had a special design of up-and-down lines on it, plus some blades were wider than others, and some were yellow, with some even having little holes that I guessed had been put there via bugs chewing them? By now as you know I am sometimes a kidder, with Humor always ranked by my peers as one of my Principal Positives on my Yearly Evaluation, but being totally serious? If I live one million years I will never forget all the beautiful things I saw and experienced in that kickass outside yard. Isn’t it something? Slippen said. But look, stand up, here is something even better. And I stood up, and here came this bland person in blue scrubs, which my first thought was, Ouch, why not accentuate that killer bone structure with some makeup, and also what is up with that dull flat hair, did you never hear of Bumble & Bumble Plasma Volumizer? And then she said my name. Not my name of Randy but my real name of Jon. Which is how I first got the shock of going, Oh my God, this poor washed-out gal is my Carolyn. And wow was her belly bigger! Then she touched my face very tender and said, The suspense of waiting is over and this year’s Taurus far exceeds expectations already high in this humble farming community. And I was like, Carolyn? And she was like, The beauty of a reunion by the sea of this mother and son will not soon again be parted and all one can say is amen and open another bag of chips, which by spreading on a thin cream on the face strips away the harsh effect of the destructive years. Then she hugged me, which is when I saw the gaping hole in her neck where her gargadisk had formerly been. But tell the truth, even with DermaFilled® neckhole and nada makeup and huge baby belly, still she looked so pretty, it was like someone had put a light inside her and switched it on. But I guess it is true what they say at LI 23005, life is full of ironic surprises, where that lady in a bikini puts on sunscreen and then there is this nuclear war and she takes a sip of her drink only she has been like burned to a crisp, because all that time Out not one LI had come up, as if my mind was stymied or holding its breath, but now all of the sudden here came all these LIs of Flowers, due to I had seen those real-life flowers, such as talking daisies for Polaroid (LI 101119), such as that kid who drops a jar of applesauce but his anal mom totally melts when he hands her a sunflower (LI 22365), such as the big word PFIZER that as you pan closer is made of roses (LI 88753), such as LI 73486, where as you fly over wildflowers to a Acura Legend on a cliff the announcer goes, Everyone is entitled to their own individual promised land. And I blinked on Pause but it did not Pause, and blinked on End but it did not End. Then up came LIs of Grass, due to I had seen that lawn, such as an old guy sprinkling grass seed while repetitively checking out his neighbor girl who is sunbathing, and then in spring he only has grass in that one spot (LI 11121), such as LI 76567, with a sweeping lawn leading up to a mansion for Grey Poupon, such as (LI 00391) these grass blades screaming in terror as this lawnmower approaches but then when they see it is a Toro they put on little party hats. Randy, can you hear me? Slippen said. Do you see Carolyn? She has been waiting out here an hour. During that hour she has been going where she wants, looking at whatever she likes. See what she is doing now? Simply enjoying the night. And that was true. Between flinches and blinks on End I could dimly persee her sitting cross-legged near me, not flinching, not blinking, just looking pretty in the moonlight with a look on her face of deep concern for me. Randy, this could all be yours, Slippen was saying. This world, this girl! And then I must have passed out. Because when I came to I was sitting inside that door marked Caution Do Not Open Without Facility Personnel Accompaniment, with my Paperwork in my lap and all my Coördinators standing around me. Randy, Dove said. Larry Slippen here claims that you wish to Exit. Is this the case? Did you in fact Request your Paperwork, then thrust it at him? O.K., I said. Yes. So they rushed me to Removals, where this nurse Vivian was like, Welcome, please step behind that screen and strip off, then put these on. Which I did, I dropped my Calvin Klein khakis and socks and removed my Country Road shirt as well as my Old Navy boxers, and put on the dreaded blue scrubs. Best of luck, Randy, Slippen said, leaning in the door. You’ll be fine. Out out out, Vivian said. Then she gave me this Patient Permission Form, which the first question was, Is patient aware of risk of significantly reduced postoperative brain function? And I wrote, Yes. And then it said, Does patient authorize Dr. Edward Kenton to perform all procedures associated with a complete gargadisk removal, including but not limited to e-wire severance, scar-tissue removal, forceful Kinney Maneuver (if necessary to fully disengage gargadisk), suturing, and postoperative cleansing using the Foreman Vacuum Device, should adequate cleaning not be achievable via traditional methods? And I wrote, Yes. I have been here since Wednesday, due to Dr. Kenton is at a wedding. I want to thank Vivian for all this paper, and Mr. Slippen for being the father I never had, and Carolyn for not giving up on me, and Dr. Kenton, assuming he does not screw it up. (Ha ha, you know, Dr. Kenton, I am just messing with you, even if you do screw it up, I know you tried your best. Only please do not screw it up, ha ha ha!) Last night they let Carolyn send me a fax from the Lerner Center, and it said, I may not look my best or be the smartest apple on the applecart but, believe me, in time I will again bake those ninety-two pies. And I faxed back, However you are is fine with me, I will see you soon, look for me, I will be the one with the ripped-up neck, smacking himself in the head! No matter what, she faxed, at least we will now have a life, that life dreamed of by so many, living in freedom with all joys and all fears, bring it on, I say, the balloon of our excitement will go up up up, to that land which is the land of true living, we will not be denied! I love you, I wrote. I love you too, she wrote. Which I thought that was pretty good, it being so simple and all, and it gave me hope. Because maybe we can do it. Maybe we can come to be normal, and sit on our porch at night, the porch of our own house, like at LI 87326, where the mom knits and the dad plays guitar and the little kid works very industrious with his Speak & Spell, and when we talk, it will make total sense, and when we look at the stars and moon, if choosing to do that, we will not think of LI 44387, where the moon frowns down at this dude due to he is hiding in his barn eating Rebel CornBells instead of proclaiming his SnackLove aloud, we will not think of LI 09383, where this stork flies through some crying stars who are crying due to the baby who is getting born is the future Mountain Dew Guy, we will not think of that alien at LI 33081 descending from the sky going, Just what is this thing called a Cinnabon? In terms of what we will think of, I do not know. When I think of what we will think of, I draw this like total blank and get scared, so scared my Peripheral Area flares up green, like when I have drank too much soda, but tell the truth I am curious, I think I am ready to try. ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

It tells you something about our school that the prospect of his arrival cooked up more interest than the contest between Nixon and Kennedy, which for most of us was no contest at all. Nixon was a straight arrow and a scold. If he’d been one of us, we would have glued his shoes to the floor. Kennedy, now—Kennedy was a warrior, an ironist, terse and unhysterical. He had his clothes under control. His wife was a fox. And he read and wrote books, one of which, “Why England Slept,” was required reading in my honors-history seminar. We recognized Kennedy; we could still see in him the boy who would have been a favorite here, roguish and literate, with that almost formal insouciance that both enacted and discounted the fact of his class. We would never have admitted that class played any part in our liking for Kennedy. Ours was not a snobbish school—or so it believed, and we wanted this to be true. It was understood that some of the boys might get a leg up thanks to their famous names or great wealth, but, if privilege immediately gave them a place, the rest of us liked to think that it was a perilous place; you could never advance in it, you could only try not to lose it by talking too much about the débutante parties you went to or the Jaguar you had earned by turning sixteen, and meanwhile, absent other distinctions, you were steadily giving ground to a system of honors that valued nothing you hadn’t done for yourself. Or that was the idea, an idea so deeply held that it was never spoken; you breathed it in with the smell of floor wax and wool and boys living close together in overheated rooms. Never uttered, so never challenged. If our school had a snobbery it would confess to, it was its pride in being a literary place—quite aside from the glamorous writers who visited three times a year. Our headmaster had studied with Frost at Amherst and once published a collection of poems, “Sonnets Against the Storm,” which it now pained him to be reminded of. Dean Makepeace had been a friend of Hemingway’s during the First World War and was said to have served as the model for Jake’s fishing buddy Bill in “The Sun Also Rises.” The other English masters carried themselves as if they, too, were intimates of Hemingway, and also of Shakespeare and Hawthorne and Donne. These men seemed to us a kind of chivalric order. Even boys without bookish hopes aped their careless style of dress and the ritual swordplay of their speech. And at the headmaster’s monthly teas I was struck by the way the other masters floated at the fringe of the English masters’ circle, as if warming themselves at a fire. How did they command such deference—English teachers? Compared with the men who taught physics and biology, what did they really know of the world? It seemed to me, and not only to me, that they knew what was most worth knowing. Unlike our math and science teachers, who modestly stuck to their subjects, they tended to be polymaths. Adept as they were at dissection, they would never leave a poem or a novel strewn about in pieces like some butchered frog reeking of formaldehyde. They would put it back together with history and psychology, philosophy, religion; even, on occasion, science. Without pandering to your presumed desire to identify with the hero of a story, they made you feel that what mattered to the writer had consequence for you, too. There was a tradition at my school by which one boy was chosen for a private audience with each writer who visited. We contended for this honor by submitting a piece of our own work (poetry if the visitor was a poet, fiction if a novelist), with the winner to be chosen by the writer a week or so before the visit. By custom, only sixth formers, boys in their final year of school, were allowed to compete. That meant that I had spent the past three years looking on helplessly as boy after boy was plucked from the crowd of suitors and invited to stroll between the headmaster’s prize roses in the blessed and blessing presence of literature itself, to speak of deep matters and receive counsel, and afterward be able to say, You liked “By Love Possessed”? You’re kidding. I mean, Jesus, you ought to hear Mary McCarthy on the subject of Cozzens. . . . It was hard to bear, especially when the winning manuscript came from the hand of someone you didn’t like or, worse, from a boy who wasn’t even known to be a contender—though this had happened just once in my years of waiting in the wings, when an apparent philistine named Hurst won an audience with Edmund Wilson for a series of satirical odes in Latin. The visiting writers didn’t know us, so no one could accuse them of playing favorites, but that didn’t stop us from disputing their tastes. How could Robert Penn Warren, for instance, prefer Kit Morton’s plain dying-grandmother story to Lance Leavitt’s stream-of-consciousness monologue from the viewpoint of a condemned man smoking his last cigarette while pouring daringly profane contempt over the judgment of a world that punishes you for one measly murder while ignoring the murder of millions? It didn’t seem right that Lance, who defied the decorums of language and bourgeois morality, should have to look on while Robert Penn Warren walked the garden with a sentimentalist like Kit (whose story, through its vulgar nakedness of feeling, had moved me to secret tears). I’m not exaggerating the importance to us of these trophy meetings. We cared. And I cared as much as anyone, because I not only read writers; I read about writers. I knew that Maupassant, whose stories I loved, had been taken up when young by Flaubert and Turgenev; Faulkner by Sherwood Anderson; Hemingway by Fitzgerald and Pound and Gertrude Stein. All these writers were welcomed by other writers. It seemed to follow that you needed such a welcome, yet before this could happen you had somehow, anyhow, to meet the writer who was to welcome you. My idea of how this worked wasn’t low or even practical; I never thought about making connections. My aspirations were mystical. I wanted to receive the laying on of hands that had written stories and poems, hands that had touched the hands of other writers. I wanted to be anointed. Frost’s visit was announced in early October. At first the news made me giddy, but that night I grew morose with the dread of defeat. I couldn’t sleep. Finally I got up and sat at my desk with two notebooks full of poetry I’d written when taking a break from stories. While my roommate muttered in his dreams I bent over the notebooks and read piece after piece like: song (#8) to the hopeless of the hopeless of the night i sing my song and hopeless end my song and do not pity me for i am without hope and do not pity them for they are without hope and There the poem ended. Beneath it I had written “fragment.” I’d written “fragment” beneath most of the poems in the notebooks, and this description was in every case accurate. Each of them had been composed in some fit of ardor or philosophy which deserted me before I could bring it to the point of significance. The few poems that I had finished seemed, in the hard circle of light thrown by the gooseneck lamp, even more disappointing. The beauty of a fragment is that it still supports the hope of brilliant completeness. I thought of stitching several of them together into a sequence, à la “The Waste Land,” but that they would thereby become meaningful seemed too much to hope for. I would have to write something new. The deadline for submission was three weeks away. I could write a poem in that time, but what kind of poem should I write? Aside from being good, it would have to stand out from the poems of my competitors, that was the problem. At least I knew (barring some dark horse like Hurst) who my competitors were. There were three. George Kellogg was the editor of our literary review, Troubadour, and a proficient writer, mainly of poetry. He wrote in traditional forms, especially the villanelle, and you could tell, reading his poetry, that he knew his stuff. His lines scanned, he used alliteration and personification. Metonymy. His poems always had a theme and were full of sympathy for the little people of the world: an old man picking his way across a fairground the morning after the fair; an old woman slowly gathering her things in a darkened theatre after everyone has left. She dons her scarf, she dons her balding fur; She takes her time, ’til Time at last takes her. I didn’t really believe that George would win. He had a certain mastery and he gave occasional intimations of power in reserve, but his poems bored me stiff. He seemed more professor than writer, with his hairy tweed cap and watch chain and slow, well-considered speech. The effect was less stuffy than dear, and that was his problem; he was too dear, too kind. I never heard him say a hard word about anyone, and it visibly grieved him when the rest of us made sport of our schoolmates. At our editorial meetings, he argued for almost every submission, even knowing that we could take only a fraction of them. It was maddening. You couldn’t tell whether he actually liked a piece or just hated turning people down. George’s benevolence did not serve his writing well. For all its fluent sympathy, it had no bite. Still, I knew better than to write George off. If he just once let a strong feeling get the better of his manners, he might land a hard one. He might win. So might Bill White, my roommate. Bill had already written most of a novel, of which we’d published the first chapter in Troubadour. A surgeon and a famous actor and his wife are isolated in a hunting lodge during a blizzard. The men are old friends, but it emerges that the actor’s wife is having an affair with the surgeon, who, it turns out, once saved the actor’s life with an impromptu tracheotomy during a safari: Buy the print » Have to take my hat off to you, said Montague. Tricky bit of tradecraft, given the circumstances. Storm blowing the damned tent down, and the beaters into the liquor. I shan’t forget it. Not at all, not at all, said Dr. Coates. The merest intern could have done as well—probably better. I shan’t forget it, Montague repeated. I’m forever in your debt, he added coldly. Aren’t we all, said Ashley, pouring herself another Scotch. She stared at the falling snow. What ever would we do without the good doctor’s services? You bitch, said Montague. You perfectly beautiful bitch. Bill hadn’t let me read the rest of his novel but I doubted that the hunting party’s meticulously described rifles would stay locked in their cases for long. Bill was a contender. His characters were stilted but he had confidence, and his stories were eventful and closely detailed. Most of the work in Troubadour suffered from generality. Bill’s talent was particularity. How the snow creaked underfoot on a very cold clear day, how the low white sun looked through a tangle of black branches. The tackiness of a just-oiled rifle stock, the sound of a bored woman brushing out her long hair in front of a fire. Everything in his work was specific and true except the people. That was a problem in the longer pieces, but in Bill’s shortest, most implicit stories, and in his occasional poems, the exactitude and poise of his writing could carry you away. He had me worried. So did Jeff Purcell, known as Little Jeff because we had in our class another Jeff Purcell, his cousin—Big Jeff. In fact, Little Jeff wasn’t little and Big Jeff wasn’t big, just bigger than Little Jeff, who resented Big Jeff, partly no doubt for inadvertently imposing this odious nickname on him. Little Jeff was a friend of mine, so, like his other friends, I called him Purcell. Purcell habitually kept his arms folded across his chest, like a Civil War general in a daguerreotype. This bellicose pose suited him. Under his bristling crewcut, he cultivated a sulfurous gift for invective and contempt. He was the Herod of our editorial sessions, poised to strike down every innocent who presumed to offer us a manuscript. He had exacting standards: moral, political, aesthetic. Purcell even flouted the timeless protocol of pretending to admire the work of his fellow-editors. At one of our meetings, he declared that a story of mine called “Suicide Note” read as if it’d been written after the narrator blew his brains out. Purcell came from a rich, social family, but you wouldn’t have guessed it from his stories and poems; or maybe you would have. His subject was the injustice of relations between high and low. He had written a ballad about a miner being dispatched deep into the earth to perish in a cave-in while the mine owner hand-feeds filet mignon to his hunting dogs, cooing to them in baby talk; and his last Troubadour piece was an epistolary story in which a general writes congratulatory letters to various widows after sending their husbands to be slaughtered: You may rejoice for your fallen hero, knowing that his heart was perforated for our glorious cause, and you and your little ones can rest assured that his missing head, wherever it may be, is filled with the pride of sacrifice and radiant memories of the homeland for which he died so eagerly. This story was, I felt sure, inspired by a certain passage in “A Farewell to Arms,” but when it came up for consideration I bit my tongue and let it go. It wasn’t bad. Cartoonish, of course, like all of Purcell’s work, lurid and overwrought, but venomously alive. Anyway, I myself was in debt to Hemingway—up to my ears. So was Bill. We even talked like Hemingway characters, though in travesty, as if to deny our discipleship: That is your bed, and it is a good bed, and you must make it and you must make it well. Today is the day of meat loaf. The meat loaf is swell. It is swell but when it is gone the not-having meat loaf is tragic and the meatloaf man will not come anymore. All of us owed someone—someone, and more than someone. We wouldn’t have admitted it in so many words, but the knowledge was surely there, because the charge of imitation was the only charge we never brought against the submissions we mocked so cruelly. There was no profit in it. Once crystallized, consciousness of influence would have been fatal to the collective and necessary fantasy that our work was purely our own. Even Purcell kept mum on the subject. He was a threat. His attack was broad, even crude, yet if he humanized his targets, muted his voice, used a knife instead of a cudgel . . . But he didn’t necessarily have to do any of that. In a field of stiffs, one of his cartoons could win for simply being alive. These, then, were the boys who stood between me and Robert Frost. Of course there were other self-confessed writers in my form, but in our English classes and as an editor of Troubadour I’d read their work and I hadn’t seen anything to worry me except their desire. So much desire! Why did so many of us want to be writers? It seemed unreasonable. But there were reasons, and one of them had to do with the problem of class. Despite our school’s hierarchy of character and deeds, class was a fact. It was not just the clothes a boy wore but the way he wore them. How he spent his summers. The games he knew how to play. His way of turning cold at the mention of money, or at the spectacle of ambition too nakedly revealed. You felt it as a depth of ease around certain boys, their innate, affable assurance that they would not have to struggle for a place in the world. A depth of ease or, in the case of Purcell and a few others, a sullen antipathy toward the padding that hemmed them in and muffled the edges of life; yet even in the act of kicking against it they were defined by it, and protected by it, and to some extent unconscious of it. Purcell himself had a collection of first editions you’d almost have to own a mine to afford. Maybe that was why so many of us wanted to become writers. Maybe it seemed to us that to be a writer was to escape the problems of blood and class. Writers formed a tribe of their own and regarded the others from a position outside the common hierarchy. This gave them a power not conferred by privilege—the power to create images of the system they stood apart from, and thereby to judge it. We had talked in class about Pasternak and his troubles, and the long history of Russian writers being imprisoned or killed for not writing as the Party wished. Augustus Caesar had sent our Latin master’s beloved Ovid into exile. Yet the effect of these stories was to make me feel not Caesar’s power but his fear of Ovid. And why would Caesar fear Ovid, unless he knew that all his legions could not protect him from a good line of poetry? The weekend before our Frost submissions were due, there was a fire at the school. Fire was the great nightmare. Early in the century, a residential house had burned to the ground with thirteen boys inside, and the fire was said to have been started by a cigarette. How anyone could know that, we didn’t ask. It was revealed truth. And it led to a commandment: Thou shalt not smoke. Get caught and you were out, that day. Even the softest masters were without mercy on this point. A boy would return from swimming practice and find his roommate gone, hangers tinkling in an empty closet, the other mattress stripped and doubled over. No announcements made. No lessons preached. Despite this, an unteachable cadre of resolutes, including me, kept smoking anyway. I’d sneaked the occasional gasper since eighth grade but at school it became an obsession. I was crazy for cigarettes, yet my true addiction was to the desperate, all-or-nothing struggle to maintain a habit in the face of unceasing official vigilance. I smoked in freezers and storage lockers and steam tunnels. I joined the Classical Music Club so that I could smoke in the bathrooms of the concert halls we visited, and went out for cross-country so that I could smoke while running in the woods. I kept a store of spearmint Life Savers to mask my breath and used a holder so my fingers wouldn’t stain. It was fretful, laborious work, but when I sucked down that first deep pang of smoke I went dizzy with pleasure. Then I almost got caught. I’d been smoking in the basement of the chapel with another boy, who was discovered there by the padre just minutes after I left. I was putting music in the choir stalls—my chore that week—when the two of them came upstairs and walked down the aisle, the padre sad but decided, holding the boy by the elbow, and the boy . . . I could only glance at him, but I saw enough. He was in free fall, still trying to believe that he was only in a dream of falling. He lived in New York. It would be a long night’s ride down on the train, alone. I could easily see myself on that train. My journey wouldn’t stop in New York, though. I’d have to catch the gritty Century to Chicago, then change to the Great Northern—day after day of rolling past factories and fields and deserts and mountains but seeing none of it, gazing at my own stunned reflection in the glass. Lying sleepless in my bed that night, I saw the school as I would have seen it from an impossible distance, crossing the plains in a darkened railway car, headed back to the chaos and muddle I’d come from. I saw the school as if I were leaving it forever, and the thought made me sick at heart. I never smoked at school again. But the temptation was persistent, and sometimes I could almost hear the old crew puffing away in the basements and attics. So my first thought when the sirens came wailing up the drive that Sunday afternoon was that one of those poor fiends had sparked a blaze somewhere and would pay the price that very hour. Who would it be? “I really can’t explain it too much except to say that it’s part of a court order.”Buy the print » I was coming out of the library. From the top of the steps I could see a thick braid of smoke twisting up over the old field house. I had been holed up most of the weekend, trying to finish my poem for the Robert Frost competition. What I’d been working on was a hunter’s elegiac meditation over the body of an elk he’s killed after tracking it for days through the mountains. This wasn’t typical of my poems, abstract and devoid of narrative as they tended to be. It fell into the pattern of a group of my stories in which a young fellow named Sam evaded the civilizing demands of his socialite mother and logger-baron father by fleeing into the forests of Washington State, where he did much hunting and fishing and laconic romancing with free-spirited women he met on the trail. I had begun this series innocently enough, in unconscious tribute to the Nick Adams stories, but over time it had evolved into something less honest. I wanted to be taken for Sam by my schoolmates, who knew nothing of my life at home. But I was having trouble with this poem. For one thing, how was the hunter, having followed the elk so far into the woods, going to get it out? How big was an elk, anyway? Really big, I guessed. The hunter, having offered thanks to the spirit of the elk for giving him all that meat, was going to look ridiculous walking away with one lousy haunch over his shoulder. Maybe I should have made it a regular deer. But “deer” didn’t have the majesty of “elk.” There was a lot to fix, and not much time left to fix it. The poem was due the next morning. A crowd was gathered at the near end of the football field. The firemen stood by their truck drinking coffee and taking turns with the hose. There were no flames, but the shingles had burned through at one end, exposing a sheet of charred sub-roofing that sent up a greasy hiss of smoke as the water played over it. I asked the boy next to me how the fire had started, and without taking his eyes off the field house he mumbled something about Jeff Purcell. Purcell. The news gave me a knock because he was my friend, and because he had invited me to spend Thanksgiving vacation with his family in Boston, and now I could look forward to nothing better than another stretch with my boring grandfather and his boring wife in a housing development outside Baltimore. False alarm! It wasn’t my Purcell, Little Jeff, who’d started the fire. It was his cousin, Big Jeff. Big Jeff had a passion. He believed that our destiny was to leave Earth behind and colonize other planets. In fifth form, he had started the Rocket Club, and though he couldn’t find any members in our class—we were too busy licking our chops for a great big bite of this planet—he did manage to recruit a few younger boys out of the Science Fiction Club. The Rocket Club met on the football field on Sunday afternoons under the eye of the chemistry master and shot off whatever they’d cooked up in the lab that week. Big Jeff had been experimenting with a two-stage rocket, but instead of going straight up the missile cut a few loops and took a dive onto the old field-house roof, where the explosive booster detonated in a clump of old pine needles and leaves. Whoosh! I started a new poem that night. It was the fire that got me going, the fire and the firemen in their open rubber coats and high gaping boots, the looks they sneaked at us and the masters and the school itself, taking it all in. Their curiosity made me look around, too. For a moment, I saw this place as I had first seen it. How beautiful it was, and how odd. I felt its seclusion and the way we’d come to resemble each other in that seclusion. We dressed so much alike that the inflections we did allow ourselves (tasselled loafers for the playboy, a black turtleneck for the rebel) were probably invisible to an outsider. Our clothes, the way we wore our hair, the very set of our mouths marked us like tribal tattoos. The firemen looked us over, and we looked them over. There was one fireman in particular I found myself watching. He had deep-set, tired-looking eyes, and held himself a little apart. He was less covert than the others in sizing us up. I thought about him after they had finished and driven away. That was how I came to write my new poem, a narrative poem in which I described a fireman coming home the morning after a big blaze. He’s been the hero of the night, braving walls of flame to rescue a little girl. Now it’s over. He goes home, and it’s Saturday morning and his kids are watching cartoons and his wife is talking on the phone. She waves and keeps talking. He fries himself some eggs but doesn’t eat them. He’s oppressed by the crumbs on the kitchen table, the dirty cereal bowls, the smell of burned toast and last night’s fish. His wife laughs into the phone. The television is too loud. Then he’s on his feet and in the living room and he’s just yelled something, he doesn’t know what, and his children are looking at him with dislike and contempt. I thought writing should give me pleasure, and generally it did. But I didn’t like writing this poem. I did it grudgingly, as if I had no choice, but in a kind of heat, too. In the end, I didn’t submit it. Maybe it was good, maybe not. Maybe it wasn’t even a poem, only a fragment of a story in broken lines. I couldn’t tell. It was too close to home; it was home—the mess, the noise, the smells, all of this just like our place on a Saturday morning. The sense of time dying, drop by drop, of stalled purpose and the close, almost aquarium atmosphere of confinement and repetition. The convulsive, futile demand for recognition and respect. I could hear and see everything in that apartment, down to the pattern in the Formica tabletop. I could see myself there, and didn’t want to. Even more, I didn’t want anyone else to. I submitted the elk-hunter poem. “Red Snow,” I called it. The day after John F. Kennedy won the Presidency, George Kellogg won the audience with Robert Frost. Our school newspaper printed his poem in a box on the front page. It was a dramatic monologue in which an old farmer feels the bite of mortality on the first cold day of autumn. George had used an odd mixture of tones. At one point the farmer is lyrically drooling at the sight of a hired girl milking a cow: Old rooster struts the rafters while the barncat begs Mewing at her feet in the stall where Flossie stands, As with swift hard strokes of her soft white hands She pulls the foaming cream into the pail between her legs. A few stanzas down he becomes a terse fatalist: Corn’s high in the silo, hay’s stacked in the loft, Cordwood’s halfway to the roof, doorcracks plugged with clay. So let come what will, hard ground, short day, I’ve done all I am able—and after all, the snow is soft. The poem was entitled, shamelessly, “First Frost.” In a telephone interview about the poem, Robert Frost told our reporter, “Young Kellogg has had some fun at this old man’s expense, and I guess this old man can stand some fun, if it isn’t too expensive.” He seemed to think that George had written some sort of burlesque; that he was using the poet’s manner and material—perhaps his very name—to give him the needle. He sounded like a man who’d been stung by a taunt, showing that he could take it and come back with some chaff of his own. But if anything stumped me more than Frost’s thinking that George’s poem was a dig in the ribs, it was the idea of the monumental Robert Frost letting some versifying teen get his goat. It didn’t seem possible. I read the poem several times. I began to imagine that maybe it was satiric, and thus better than I’d first thought. But George set me straight when I went to his room that afternoon to congratulate him. He was sitting on his bed. He still had his tie on, a knitted tie with a flat bottom. It looked crocheted; it looked like a doily. Our biology master wore ties like that, but George was the only boy you’d catch dead in one. Most of the scholarship students, myself included, took some care with the figure they cut. Not George. He was both the oldest and the youngest of us, the most fuddy-duddy and the most innocent. What did you think of the poem, he asked me. I told him I liked it. Way to go! Robert Frost, George, you’re going to meet Robert Frost! Did you think I was . . . how did Mr. Frost put it . . . having fun at his expense? Well, I guess you could read it that way. You could? Nuts. He slumped like a puppet. But you don’t have to, I said. You can also read it as tribute. You know, the farm, the folksy tone, the snow. It’s like you’re paying your respects to him—tipping your hat, so to speak. Exactly! That’s exactly the way I meant it. As an hommage, he added. And, of course, the title, I said. You like the title? All those layers of meaning. “First Frost” as in, literally, the first frost of the year. Then “First Frost” in the symbolic sense, here comes winter; i.e. death, but also rest, right? The snow is soft, after all, after all the hard work he’s spent his life doing—soft and white like the girl’s hands. After all, in a funny way, he’s gonna get what he wants. Unless I’m just reading this stuff into it. . . . No! No, it’s all there. Then, I said, the crowning touch. “First Frost” as in First, Frost—as in Frost is tops, Frost is the best, Frost is literally No. 1. Exactly! Exactly. Robert Frost arrived at the school during dinner. When he appeared in the dining hall, slowly crossing from the side door with the headmaster, gingerly mounting the two steps to the high table, the ordinary din of the hall died almost to silence. We kept eating and tried not to stare, but we couldn’t help ourselves. Frost let himself down into the chair at the headmaster’s right, facing out toward the hall. He bent his big white head as he arranged his napkin, taking his time. He seemed deeply absorbed in the problem of the napkin. Then Dean Makepeace rose at the head of his table, turned toward Robert Frost, and began to clap in a measured, decorous way, each report of his hands sharp as a shot, and the rest of us jumped to our feet in a great scrape of chairs and made the hall thunderous with applause and the rhythmic drumming of our feet on the oaken floor. Frost gave a little bow with his head, but we kept the racket up, and finally his reserve broke and he smiled boyishly and rose partway in his chair and waved his napkin at us like a flag of surrender. “Now that I’ve been let go, the commute is all I have.”Buy the print » I was conscious of him through the rest of the meal, and held myself as though he were conscious of me. Some of the other boys at my table also suffered fits of dignity. The atmosphere in the hall had become theatrical. This had everything to do with Frost himself. There was an element of performance in his bearing—even the business with the napkin, awkward as it seemed, had a calculated quality. It charged the room and put us on edge, not at all unpleasantly—as if a glamorous woman were eating alongside us. Frost read in the chapel that night. The headmaster climbed the steps to the pulpit to introduce him. He was a lanky, long-faced man with a wen over his right eyebrow. It was a big blistery-looking thing and when you first met him you could see nothing else, but he soon distracted you by holding your eyes with his, deep-set and attentive, and with the arresting beauty of his voice. He had a profound bass full of gravel, which he used to good effect and to his own satisfaction. I had expected him to use this moment to take a swipe at the Ginsberg-Ferlinghetti crime family, which had a few soldiers among us. But no. Instead, the headmaster told a story of how, as a farm boy who’d never been interested in poetry, he had idly picked up his teacher’s copy of “North of Boston,” and read a poem entitled “After Apple-picking.” He’d approached it, he said, in a surly humor. He’d done more than a bit of apple-picking himself and was sure that this poem would try to make it fancy and romantic and get it all wrong. But what struck him first was how physically true the poem was, even down to that ache you get in the arch of your foot after standing on a ladder all day—not only the ache but the lingering pressure of the rung. And, once he had assented to the details, he was drawn to the poem’s more mysterious musings. What was that pane of ice about? Which part of the poem was dream, and which part memory? He borrowed the book, never suspecting where this act would lead him. Make no mistake, he said: a true piece of writing is a dangerous thing. It can change your life. He came back down the steps. That was all. No recitation of Frost’s honors and awards, no witty, polished reminiscences. I had never before heard the headmaster speak of himself in this way, as someone with a particular past, and never did again. He was a mystery to us, and, like great generals and actresses, he guarded his mystery like the power it was. He helped Robert Frost up the winding steps and then joined us in the pews. This left Frost alone at the front of the church. He arranged his books and some loose papers in a certain order, then rearranged them. The papers rustled loudly under the microphone. At this, he stopped and inspected the mike as if the device were new to him. He tapped it suspiciously. The tap made a resounding knock and he shied back a little. He picked up a book, rifled through the pages, set it down again. He peered out at us. Can you hear me? You can hear me, you boys in the back? Well then. Good. That’s good. I suppose I should read you a poem. But I was just thinking about something Shelley said . . . you know, Shelley, fellow who wrote “Ozymandias”—it’s in your books. Friend of Byron, friend of Keats. Anyway, Shelley liked to say that we poets are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind. They used to speak like that in those days—by the pound. Unacknowledged legislators of mankind. Wonder if it’s true. Wonder what it means. Does it mean we’re dangerous, like your headmaster says? What does your man Kellogg think? Is Mr. Kellogg here tonight? Frost waited, gazing out at us until George stood up, a couple of seats to my right. He looked furtive and damp. He looked like a sinner in a Last Judgment painting, about to get his due. And Frost, Frost looked like Himself up there in the pulpit. He was standing below one of the chandeliers, whose wintry light silvered his hair and made shadows on his weathered face. He didn’t look old; he looked eternal. He took George in. So, he said. Mr. Kellogg. That was quite a piece of legislation you wrote. Bet you had some fun with it, too, holding the old man’s feet to the fire. Good for you, good for you. Old men should have their feet held to the fire—keeps ’em awake. All right, boys, they’ve brought me down here to sing for my supper, so I’d better do some singing. I wrote this one when I was lonely for home, many years ago, in England. I expect you boys know about homesickness. It’s called “Mending Wall.” He lowered his eyes to read, and George wilted back into the pew. Something there is that doesn’t love a wall, That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, And spills the upper boulders in the sun Frost picked his way slowly through the first line, as if the thought were just occurring to him. And then his dry voice filled like a sail and became good-humored and natural and young. He was good at masking his eyes under those hanging brows of his, but now and then I saw him shift his gaze from the page to us without losing a word. He wasn’t reading; he was reciting. He knew the poems by heart, yet he continued to make a show of reading them, even to the extent of pretending to lose his place or have trouble with the light. His awkwardness took nothing from his poems. Rather, it removed them from the page and put them back in the voice, a speculative, sometimes cunning, sometimes faltering voice. In print, under his great name, the poems had the look of inevitability; in his voice you caught the hesitation and perplexity behind them, the sound of a man brooding them into being. Frost read on, poem after poem, until the underclassmen began to cough and set their pews groaning. Then he raised his head and took us in. You boys are champion sitters, he said. You’ve got Sitzfleisch, as our great new friends the Germans would say. That’s enough for one night, eh? Maybe just one more, what do you think, for your man Kellogg. Yes? All right then. I have just the poem here. Still looking at us, Frost recited “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.” Then he gathered his books and papers while we applauded. The headmaster went up the steps, conferred with Frost, came down again and raised his hand for silence. He told us that Mr. Frost had agreed to take a few questions, if we had any. I had questions. How did he know he was a good writer all those years when nobody else knew? What did it feel like to write something really great? Why did he choose George’s poem? Sir, if I may. I looked around. It was Mr. Ramsey, one of the masters. He was standing in his pew. Even in this dimness his chubby cheeks showed their youthful English bloom. Mrs. Ramsey plucked at something on her sleeve. He had married her four years earlier out of some Southern women’s college where he’d taught right after leaving Oxford. She was just a freshman at the time and Mr. Ramsey lost his job and brought her north to Putney and then to us. Mrs. Ramsey worked in the library and never lacked for boys needing help. She wore her honey-colored hair in long girlish braids, and she had a teasing way with us. She looked at us as if she knew what we were thinking. She had still been in love with Mr. Ramsey when they’d arrived two years back. We had all seen it. She’d hung on his voice, quoted his pronouncements. Lately, this had changed. I’d seen her look bored at dinner, while Mr. Ramsey was going on about something. On occasion, she turned away while he was still talking and began to chat with the boy next to her. Your work, sir, Mr. Ramsey said, follows a certain tradition, shall we say, a formal tradition, as in that last poem you read, “Stopping in Woods.” I wonder— “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” Frost said. He put both hands on the pulpit and peered at Mr. Ramsey. Yes, sir. Now that particular poem is not unusual in your work for being written in stanza form, with iambic lines connected by rhyme. Good for you, Frost said. They must be teaching you boys something here. There was a great eruption of laughter, more caustic than jolly. Mr. Ramsey waited it out as Frost looked slyly around the chapel, the lord of misrule. He was not displeased by the havoc his mistake had caused, you could see that, and you had to wonder if it was a mistake at all. Finally he said, You had a question? Yes, sir. The question is whether such a rigidly formal arrangement of language is adequate to express the modern consciousness. Modern consciousness, Frost said. What’s that? Ah! Good question, sir. Well—very roughly speaking, I would describe it as the mind’s response to industrialization, the saturation propaganda of governments and advertisers, two world wars, the concentration camp, the dimming of faith by science, and, of course, the constant threat of annihilation. Surely these things have had an effect on us. Surely they have changed our thinking. Surely nothing, Frost said. He stared down at Mr. Ramsey. Don’t tell me about science, he went on. I’m something of a scientist myself. Botany. You boys know what tropism is? That’s what makes a plant grow toward the light. Everything aspires to the light. You don’t have to chase down a fly to get rid of it—you just darken the room and leave a crack of light in a window, and out he goes. Works every time. We all have that instinct . . . that aspiration. Science can’t—what was the word? dim?—science can’t dim that. All science can do is turn out the false lights in the room so the true light can get us home. Mr. Ramsey began to say something, but Frost kept going. So don’t tell me about science, he said, and don’t tell me about war. I lost my nearest friend in the one they call the Great War. So did Achilles lose his friend in war, and Homer did no injustice to his grief by writing about it in dactylic hexameters. There’ve always been wars, and they’ve always been as foul as we could make them. It is very fine and pleasant to think ourselves the most put-upon folk in history, but then everyone has thought that from the beginning—it makes a grand excuse for all manner of laziness. But about my friend. I wrote a poem for him. I still write poems for him. Would you honor your own friend by putting words down anyhow, just as they come to you—no thought for the sound they make, the meaning of their sound, the sound of their meaning? He broke off and let his eyes roam over the room. “It’s a pity they had to stop work on the new mall.”Buy the print » I am thinking of Achilles’ grief, he said. That famous grief . . . that terrible grief. Let me tell you boys something. Such grief can only be told in form. Maybe it only really exists in form. Form is everything. Without it you’ve got nothing but a stubbed-toe sort of cry, sincere maybe, for what that’s worth, but with no depth or carry. No echo. You may have a grievance, but you don’t have grief, and grievances are for petitions, not poetry. Does that answer your question? I’m not sure—but thank you for having a go at it. You wouldn’t have guessed, seeing Mr. Ramsey settle back with a smile, that he’d just been stepped on by Robert Frost in front of the whole school. He had been my fifth-form English teacher and though I hadn’t liked him I had found him interesting, as I had found his question to Frost interesting. But many of his students thought him a humbug for his high diction and unyieldingly intellectual tone. They had surely enjoyed this little show. The headmaster stood and led us in a last storm of applause and then we filed out of the chapel into a hard, freezing wind. I asked George if he was headed to Blaine Hall, where it was rumored that Robert Frost might drop by for a cup of mulled cider with the English Club. No, George said. He was going back to his room. Why? Scared he’ll give you the business? He was just teasing you, George. He shook his head. Mr. Frost really thinks my poem is some kind of mockery of his work. He’s the one who chose it. If it bothered him, why did he choose it? I don’t know why Mr. Frost chose my poem, he said. But he seems out of sorts about it. What the hell. You can clear things up with him when you have your audience tomorrow. If I have my audience. What, you think he’ll blow you off? I didn’t say that. George. Hold up. Hold up! We stopped on the path. The line of boys shuffled past us. A derelict kite flapped frantically in a tree. George looked away from me, tweed hat pulled low on his head, back to the wind. I think I’m coming down with something, he said. George, you can’t stand up Robert Frost. It wouldn’t count as standing him up if I was in the infirmary. You chickenshit. You big baby. George hunched deeper into his coat, hands jammed in the pockets. You don’t stand up Robert Frost, I said. This is something special. This is something to tell your kids about. Your grandkids! He won’t mind. He’ll be glad. George. This is really dumb. Where are you supposed to meet him, anyway? Headmaster’s parlor. When? After breakfast, George said, then he turned and looked at me. Why? Just wondered. Are you really going to back out? I don’t know. It’d be a complete waste if you backed out. I mean, he’s here, George. Robert Frost is here. This is the chance of a lifetime. He’s what, eighty-six, eighty-seven years old. It’s now or never. I understand that. So are you going to back out? Because if you are, there’s no point in a chance like that going to waste. I saw George begin to understand me. This has nothing to do with you, he said. I’m just saying, why throw a chance like this away? He’s willing to spend some time with one of us. If you won’t meet with him, let somebody else. He didn’t choose your poem. He chose my poem. Would you actually accept an honor you didn’t earn? Oh, like you earned it with those rhymes of yours? Please—we’re not talking about “Paradise Lost” here. George looked at me with cold curiosity. It unsettled me, but my blood was up and I couldn’t stop myself. Would I accept a meeting with Robert Frost? I said. An unearned meeting, as opposed to an earned meeting, like yours? You bet your sweet ass I would. George turned and started across the quad. I followed. Are you backing out or not? He didn’t answer. Wait’ll he gets you alone, you baby. He’ll chop you into little pieces. I stopped and watched him bend into the wind, coattails streaming. Robert Frost didn’t turn up in Blaine Hall that night, but Mrs. Ramsey did. Her solitary entrance put everyone on alert; it was as though a song were going up an octave. Faculty wives didn’t attend such gatherings without their husbands, and as the adviser to the English Club Mr. Ramsey was supposed to serve as host. Mrs. Ramsey said that he had a touch of the flu, and wanted her to stand in for him, and pay his respects should Robert Frost appear. I heard her tell this to some masters and their wives as she carried a plate of cookies around the crowded room. Bill White and I were standing by the fireplace when she approached us with the cookies. We each picked one, and as she repeated her brave little lie Bill reached out and took the plate from her and set it on the mantel. I was struck by his confidence. Somehow I didn’t like it, but I liked the result—having Mrs. Ramsey linger with us. She said she had seen Robert Frost read once before, when she was a student at Foxcroft, and afterward he had met with the lit’ry girls and talked about everything under the sun. He’d been very funny, which surprised her, though she supposed it shouldn’t have, and a terrible flirt. Of course, he got plenty of encouragement. The heat from the fire brought a flush to her face and made her perfume thicker, headier. She turned to Mr. Rice, an English master and a Southerner himself, who was tapping the ashes from his pipe into the fireplace. Do you think he’ll come tonight? she asked. Frost? I doubt it. He seemed pretty well played out, by the end there. Shoot, she said. Just then some of the boys started to sing, and others chimed in, the masters and their wives looking on tenderly. When I first arrived at the school I had wondered at the way a bunch of boys would suddenly give voice like this, on the bus coming home from a game, in a sound-swelling stone hallway. Now I knew the songs, too, and I quickened to those moments when we leaned together, watching each other for cues, and joined our voices. The singers began to gather around the fireplace. Mr. Rice gave way and drifted back toward the other masters, but Mrs. Ramsey stayed with us and was soon surrounded by the chorus we’d become. She swayed to the music, laughing softly at a witty stanza, closing her eyes at a romantic line. She didn’t so much listen to the songs as receive them, as if we were serenading her. And we were serenading her. She was a woman alone among us, eyes shining, color high, a pretty woman made beautiful by tribute of song. We could see our power to charm her and make her beautiful, and this gave boldness to our voices. It was exciting and not quite proper. When one of the masters called a halt to it after several numbers, pleading the lateness of the hour, we broke off as if coming out of a trance, hardly knowing where we were. Mrs. Ramsey seemed a little dazed herself, and skittish. She collected some dirty cups and wandered back to the cider bowl, where I saw her in conversation with the Greek master’s elderly wife. The next time I looked she was gone. Frost never showed. I stayed until the end, even offered to help with the clean-up, but the wives stuffed my pockets with cookies and sent me packing. After breakfast, I chanced some demerits and skipped my warm, easy chore—helping sort that morning’s mail—to stand by the gate to the headmaster’s garden. I kept my vigil for half an hour or so. No one came. I figured George had chickened out after all. But I was wrong. We walked to our dorm together after dinner that night—George couldn’t hold a grudge—and he told me he’d spent more than an hour alone with Frost in the headmaster’s parlor. They’d started talking and never made it outside. Frost didn’t say much about George’s poem, not in so many words, anyway, but he recited a few of his own and gave George some pointers. He also gave him an inscribed copy of his “Complete Poems,” and an invitation to drop by for a visit if he should ever find himself in Frost’s neighborhood. Ah, I said. Great. We walked along. Then George said that Frost had left him with some advice. What was that? Do you know where Kamchatka is? Not exactly. Alaska? Somewhere up there. Mr. Frost told me I was wasting my time in school. He said I should go to Kamchatka. Or Brazil. Kamchatka? Why Kamchatka? Why Brazil? He didn’t explain. He was going to, but then he had to leave. Jesus. Kamchatka. Kamchatka. Later that night I went to the library and looked up Kamchatka. It was a peninsula in the remote far east of the Soviet Union, on the Bering Sea. Very few people lived there. It was dark half the year so they couldn’t grow much of anything. They lived on the salted meat of salmon and also of bears, which greatly outnumbered the people and proved a sorrow to the unwary. When the taiga wasn’t frozen over, it swarmed with biting insects. There were many volcanos and they were active. The only picture in the Kamchatka entry showed two figures in parkas watching the top of a mountain being carried skyward on a fist of flame. I closed the encyclopedia and sat listening to the wind rattle the mullioned panes behind me. What was it about Kamchatka, that a young writer should forsake his schooling and go there? Spectacle, maybe. The drama of strange people living strangely. Danger. All this could be good matter for stories and poems. But Frost himself had lived in New England all his life at no cost to his art, and I wondered if he’d ever actually been there. I guessed not. But it meant something to him, Kamchatka, something to do with the writer’s life, and what else could it mean but hardship? Solitude, darkness, and hardship. But he had also mentioned Brazil. I rose from my deep chair and crossed the room past boys dozing over books and exchanged the “K” volume for “B.” ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

It's too narrow, and while trucks don't belong on this road, there they are, lots of them. Tourist pulloffs and wild animals on the highway complete the picture. We could have gone by way of Ennis, but Louise had learned that there were road repairs on Montana Highway 84—twelve miles of torn-up asphalt—in addition to its being rodeo weekend, and “Do we have to go to Idaho?” she asked. I said that I thought it was obvious. A lot rode on the success of our little jaunt, which was ostensibly to close the sale of a small car dealership I owned in the sleepy town of Rigby. But, since accepting the offer of a local buyer, I had received a far better one from elsewhere, which, my attorney said, I couldn't take unless my original buyer backed out—and he would only back out if he got sufficiently angry at me. Said my attorney: Make him mad. So I was headed to Rigby, Idaho, expressly to piss off a small-town businessman, who was trying to give me American money for a going concern on the strip east of town, and thereby make room for a rich Atlanta investor, new to our landscapes, who needed this dealership as a kind of flagship for his other intentions. The question was how to provoke Rigby without arousing his suspicions, and I might have collected my thoughts a little better had I not had to battle trucks and tourists in the Gallatin Canyon. Louise and I had spent a lot of time together in recent years, and we were both probably wondering where things would go from here. She had been married, briefly, long ago, and that fact, together with the relatively peaceful intervening years, gave a pleasant detachment to most of her relationships, including the one she had with me. In the past, that would have suited me perfectly; but it did not seem to suit me now, and I was so powerfully attached to her it made me uncomfortable that she wasn't interested in discussing our mutual future, though at least she had never suggested that we wouldn't have one. With her thick blond hair pulled back in a barrette, her strong, shapely figure, and the direct fullness of her mouth, she was often noticed by other men. After ten years in Montana, she still had a strong Massachusetts accent. Louise was a lawyer, specializing in the adjudication of water rights between agricultural and municipal interests. In our rapidly changing world, she was much in demand. Though I wished we could spend more time together, Louise had taught me not to challenge her on this. No longer the country crossroads of recent memory, Four Corners was filled with dentists' offices, fast-food and espresso shops, large and somehow foreboding filling stations that looked, at night, like colonies in space; nevertheless, the intersection was true to its name, sending you north to a transcontinental interstate, east into town, west to the ranches of Madison County, and south, my reluctant choice, up the Gallatin Canyon to Yellowstone and the towns of southeast Idaho, one of which contained property with my name on the deed. We joined the stream of traffic heading south, the Gallatin River alongside and usually much below the roadway, a dashing high-gradient river with anglers in reflective stillness at the edges of its pools, and bright rafts full of delighted tourists in flotation jackets and crash helmets sweeping through its white water. Gradually, the mountains pressed in on all this humanity, and I found myself behind a long line of cars trailing a cattle truck at well below the speed limit. This combination of cumbersome commercial traffic and impatient private cars was a lethal mixture that kept our canyon in the papers, as it regularly spat out corpses. In my rearview mirror, I could see a line behind me that was just as long as the one ahead, stretching back, thinning, and vanishing around a green bend. There was no passing lane for several miles. A single amorous elk could have turned us all into twisted, smoking metal. “You might have been right,” Louise said. “It doesn't look good.” She almost certainly had better things to do. But, looking down the line of cars, I felt my blood pressure rising. Her hands rested quietly in her lap. I couldn't possibly have rivalled such serenity. “How do you plan to anger this guy in Rigby?” she asked. “I'm going to try haughtiness. If I suggest that he bought the dealership cheap, he might tell me to keep the damn thing. The Atlanta guy just wants to start somewhere. All these people have a sort of parlay mentality and they need to get on the playing field before they can start running it up. I'm a trader. It all happens for me in the transition. The moment of liquidation is the essence of capitalism.” “What about the man in Rigby?” “He's an end user. He wants to keep it.” I reflected on the pathos of ownership and the way it could bog you down. “You should be in my world,” Louise said. “According to the law, water has no reality except its use. In Montana, water isn't even wet. Every time some misguided soul suggests that fish need it, it ends up in the state supreme court.” Birds were fleeing the advance of automobiles. I was elsewhere, trying to imagine my buyer, red-faced, storming out of the closing. I'd offer to let bygones be bygones, I'd take him to dinner, I'd throw a steak into him, for Christ's sake. In the end, he'd be glad he wasn't stuck with the lot. Traffic headed toward us, far down the road. We were all packed together to make sure no one tried to pass. The rules had to be enforced. Occasionally, someone drifted out for a better look, but not far enough that someone else could close his space and possibly seal his fate. This trip had its risks. I had only recently admitted to myself that I would like to make more of my situation with Louise than currently existed. Though ours was hardly a chaste relationship, real intimacy was relatively scarce. People in relationships nowadays seemed to retain their secrets like bank deposits—they always set some aside, in case they might need them to spend on someone new. I found it unpleasant to think that Louise could be withholding anything. But I thought I was more presentable than I had been. When Louise and I first met, I was just coming off two and a half years of peddling satellite dishes in towns where a couple of dogs doing the wild thing in the middle of the road amounted to the high point of a year, and the highest-grossing business was a methamphetamine tent camp out in the sagebrush. Now I had caught the upswing in our local economy—cars, storage, tool rental, and mortgage-discounting. I had a pretty home, debt-free, out on Sourdough. I owned a few things. I could be O.K. I asked Louise what she thought of the new prosperity around us. She said, wearily, “I'm not sure it's such a good thing, living in a boomtown. It's basically a high-end carny atmosphere.” We were just passing Storm Castle and Garnet Mountain. When I glanced in the mirror, I saw a low red car with a scoop in its hood pull out to pass. I must have reacted somehow, because Louise asked me if I would like her to drive. “No, that's fine. Things are getting a bit lively back there.” “Drive defensively.” “Not much choice, is there?” I had been mentally rehearsing the closing in Rigby, and I wasn't getting anywhere. I had this sort of absurd picture of myself strutting into the meeting. I tried again to picture the buyer looking seriously annoyed, but I'd met him before and he seemed pretty levelheaded. I suspected I'd have to be really outlandish to get a rise out of him. He was a fourth-generation resident of Rigby, so I could always urge him to get to know his neighbors, I decided. Or, since he had come up through the service department, I could try emphasizing the need to study how the cars actually ran. I'd use hand signals to fend off objections. I felt more secure. Some elk had wandered into the parking lot at Buck's T4 and were grazing indifferently as people pulled off the highway to admire them. I don't know if it was the great unmarred blue sky overhead or the balsamic zephyr that poured down the mountainside, but I found myself momentarily buoyed by all this idleness, people out of their cars. I am always encouraged when I see animals doing something other than running for their lives. In any case, the stream of traffic ahead of us had been much reduced by the pedestrian rubbernecking. “My husband lived here one winter,” Louise said. “He sold his pharmacy after we divorced, not that he had to, and set out to change his life. He became a mountain man, wore buckskin clothes. He tried living off the land one day a week, with the idea that he would build up. But then he just stuck with one day a week—he'd shoot a rabbit or something, more of a diet, really. He's a real-estate agent now, at Big Sky. I think he's doing well. At least he's quit killing rabbits.” “Remarried?” “Yes.” As soon as we hit the open country around West Yellowstone, Louise called her office. When her secretary put her on hold, Louise covered the mouthpiece and said, “He married a super gal. Minnesota, I think. She should be good for Bob, and he's not easy. Bob's from the South. For men, it's a full-time job being Southern. It just wears them out. It wore me out, too. I developed doubtful behaviors. I pulled out my eyelashes, and ate twenty-eight hundred dollars' worth of macadamia nuts.” Her secretary came back on the line, and Louise began editing her schedule with impressive precision, mouthing the word “sorry” to me when the conversation dragged on. I began musing about my capacity to live successfully with someone as competent as Louise. There was no implied hierarchy of status between us, but I wondered if, in the long run, something would have to give. West Yellowstone seemed entirely given over to the well-being of the snowmobile, and the billboards dedicated to it were anomalous on a sunny day like today. By winter, schoolchildren would be petitioning futilely to control the noise at night so that they could do their schoolwork, and the town would turn a blind eye as a cloud of smoke arose to gas residents, travellers, and park rangers alike. It seemed incredible to me that recreation could acquire this level of social momentum, that it could be seen as an inalienable right. We came down Targhee Pass and into Idaho, into a wasteland of spindly pines that had replaced the former forest, and Louise gave voice to the thoughts she'd been having for the past few miles. “Why don't you just let this deal close? You really have no guarantees from the man from Atlanta. And there's a good-faith issue here, too, I think.” “A lawyerly notation.” “So be it, but it's true. Are you trying to get every last cent out of this sale?” “That's second. The first priority is to be done with it. It was meant to be a passive investment, and it has turned out not to be. I get twenty calls a day from the dealership, most with questions I can't answer. It's turning me into a giant bullshit machine.” “No investments are really passive.” “Mutual funds are close.” “That's why they don't pay.” “Some of them pay, or they would cease to exist.” “You make a poor libertarian, my darling. You sound like that little puke David Stockman.” “Stockman was right about everything. Reagan just didn't have the guts to take his advice.” “Reagan. Give me a break.” I didn't mind equal billing in a relationship, but I did dread the idea of parties speaking strictly from their entitlements across a chasm. Inevitably, sex would make chaos of much of this, but you couldn't, despite Benjamin Franklin's suggestion, “use venery” as a management tool. Louise adjusted her seat back and folded her arms, gazing at the sunny side of the road. The light through the windshield accentuated the shape of her face, now in repose. I found her beautiful. I adored her when she was a noun and was alarmed when she was a verb, which was usually the case. I understood that this was not the best thing I could say about myself. When her hand drifted over to my leg, I hardly knew what to do with this reference to the other life we led. I knew that it was an excellent thing to be reminded of how inconsequential my worldly concerns were, but one warm hand, rested casually, and my interest travelled to the basics of the species. Ashton, St. Anthony, Sugar City: Mormon hamlets, small farms, and the furious reordering of watersheds into industrial canals. Irrigation haze hung over the valley of the Snake, and the skies were less bright than they had been just a few miles back, in Montana. Many locals had been killed when the Teton Dam burst, and despite that they wanted to build it again: the relationship to water here was like a war, and in war lives are lost. These were the folk to whom I'd sold many a plain car; ostentation was thoroughly unacceptable hereabouts. The four-door sedan with a six-cylinder engine was the desired item, an identical one with a hundred and fifty thousand miles on it generally taken in trade at zero value, thanks to the manipulation of rebates against the manufacturer's suggested retail. Appearances were foremost, and the salesman who could leave a customer's smugness undisturbed flourished in this atmosphere. I had two of them, potato-fattened, bland opportunists with nine kids between them. They were the asset I was selling; the rest was little more than bricks and mortar. We pressed on toward Rexburg, and amid the turnoffs for Wilford, Newdale, Hibbard, and Moody the only thing that had any flavor was Hog Hollow Road, which was a shortcut to France—not the one in Europe but the one just a hop, skip, and a jump south of Squirrel, Idaho. There were license-plate holders with my name on them in Squirrel, and I was oddly vain about that. “Sure seems lonesome around here,” Louise said. “Oh, boy.” “The houses are like little forts.” “The winters are hard.” But it was less that the small neat dwellings around us appeared defensive than that they seemed to be trying to avoid attracting the wrath of some inattentive god. “It looks like government housing for Eskimos. They just sit inside waiting for a whale, or something.” This banter had the peculiar effect of making me want to cleave to Louise, and desperately, too—to build a warm new civilization, possibly in a foolish house with turrets. The road stretched before me like an arrow. There was only enough of it left before Rigby for me to say, perhaps involuntarily, “I wonder if we shouldn't just get married.” Louise quickly looked away. Her silence conferred a certain seriousness on my question. But there was Rigby, and, in the parlance of all who have extracted funds from locals, Rigby had been good to me. Main Street was lined with ambitious and beautiful stone buildings, old for this part of the world. Their second and third floors were now affordable housing, and their street levels were occupied by businesses hanging on by their fingernails. You could still detect the hopes of the dead, their dreams, even, though it seemed to be only a matter of time before the wind carried them away, once and for all. I drove past the car lot at 200 East Fremont without comment and—considering the amount of difficulty it had caused me in the years before I got it stabilized and began to enjoy its very modest yields—without much feeling. I remembered the day, sometime earlier, when I had tried to help park the cars in the front row and got everything so crooked that the salesmen, not concealing their contempt, had to do it all over again. The title company where we were heading was on the same street, and it was a livelier place, from the row of perky evergreens out front to the merry receptionist who greeted us, a handsome young woman, probably a farm girl only moments before, enjoying the clothes, makeup, and perquisites of the new world that her firm was helping to build. We were shown into a spacious conference room with a long table and chairs, freshly sharpened pencils, and crisp notepads bearing the company letterhead. “Shall I stay?” Louise asked, the first thing she'd said since my earlier inadvertent remark, which I intuited had not been altogether rejected. “Please,” I said, gesturing toward a chair next to the one I meant to take. At that moment, the escrow agent entered and, standing very close to us, introduced himself as Brent Colby. Then he went to the far end of the table, where he spread his documents around in an orderly fan. Colby was around fifty, with iron-gray hair and a deeply lined face. He wore pressed jeans, a brilliant-white snap-button shirt, cowboy boots, and a belt buckle with a steer head on it. He had thick, hairy hands and a gleaming wedding band. Just as he raised his left wrist to check his watch, the door opened and Oren Johnson, the buyer, entered. He went straight to Louise and, taking her hand in both of his, introduced himself. It occurred to me that, in trying to be suave, Oren Johnson had revealed himself to be a clodhopper, but I was probably just experiencing the mild hostility that emanates from every sale of property. Oren wore a suit, though it suggested less a costume for business than one for church. He had a gold tooth and a cautious pompadour. He, too, bore an investment-grade wedding band, and I noted that there was plenty of room in his black-laced shoes for his toes. He turned and said that it was good to see me again after so long. The time had come for me to go into my act. With grotesque hauteur, I said that I didn't realize we had ever met. This was work. Oren Johnson bustled with inchoate energy; he was the kind of small-town leader who sets an example by silently getting things done. He suggested this just by arranging his pencils and notepad and repositioning his chair with rough precision. Locking eyes with me, he stated that he was a man of his word. I didn't know what he was getting at, but took it to mean that the formalities of a closing were superfluous to the old-time handshake with which Oren Johnson customarily did business. I smiled and quizzically cocked my head as if to say that the newfangled arrangements with well-attested documents promptly conveyed to the courthouse suited me just fine, that deals made on handshakes were strictly for the pious or the picturesque. My message was clear enough that Louise shifted uncomfortably in her chair, and Brent Colby knocked his documents edgewise on the desk to align them. As far as Oren Johnson was concerned, I was beginning to feel that anyone who strayed from the basic patterns of farm life to sell cars bore watching. Like a Method actor, I already believed my part. “You're an awfully lucky man, Oren Johnson,” I said to him, leaning back in my chair. I could see Louise openmouthed two seats away from Brent Colby, and observing myself through her eyes gave me a sudden burst of panic. “Oh?” Oren Johnson said. “How's that?” “How's that?” I did a precise job of replicating his inflection. “I am permitting you to purchase my car lot. You've seen the books: how often does a man get a shot at a business where all the work's been done for him?” Brent Colby was doing an incomplete job of concealing his distaste; he was enough of a tinhorn to clear his throat theatrically. But Oren Johnson treated this as a colossal interruption and cast a firm glance his way. “It doesn't look all that automatic to me,” he said. “Aw, hell, you're just going to coin it. Pull the lever and relax!” “What about the illegal oil dump? I wish I had a nickel for every crankcaseful that went into that hole. Then I wouldn't worry about what's going to happen when the D.E.Q. lowers the boom.” “Maybe you ought to ride your potato harvester another year or two, if you're so risk-averse. Cars are the future. They're not for everybody.” Oren Johnson's face reddened. He pushed his pencils and notepad almost out of reach in the middle of the conference table. He contemplated these supplies a moment before raising his eyes to mine. “I suppose you could put this car lot where the sun don't shine, if that suits you.” Johnson having taken a stand, I immediately felt unsure that I even had another buyer. Had I ever acknowledged how much I longed to get rid of this business and put an end to all those embarrassing phone calls? I wanted to hand the moment off to someone else while I collected my thoughts, but as I looked around the room I found no one who was interested in rescuing me—least of all Louise, who had raised one eyebrow at the vast peculiarity of my performance. Suddenly, I was desperate to keep the deal from falling apart. I gave my head a little twist to free my neck from the constrictions of my collar. I performed this gesture too vigorously, and I had the feeling that it might seem like the first movement of some sort of dance filled with sensual flourishes and bordering on the moronic. I had lost my grip. “Oren,” I said, and the familiarity seemed inappropriate. “I was attached to this little enterprise. I wanted to be sure you valued it.” The deal closed, and I had my check. I tipped back in my chair to think of a few commemorative words for the new owner, but the two men left the room without giving me the chance to speak. I shrugged at Louise, and she, too, rose to go, pausing a moment beneath an enormous Kodachrome of a bugling elk. I was aware of her distance, and I sensed that my waffling hadn't gone over particularly well. I concluded that at no time in the future would I act out a role to accomplish anything. This decision quickly evaporated with the realization that that is practically all we do in life. Comedy failed, too. When I told Louise that I had been within an inch of opening a can of whup-ass on the buyer, I barely got a smile. There's nothing more desolating than having a phrase like that die on your lips. It was dark when we got back to Targhee Pass. Leaving town, we passed the Beehive assisted-living facility and the Riot Zone, a “family fun park.” Most of the citizens we spotted there seemed unlikely rioters. I drove past a huge neon steak, its blue T-bone flashing above a restaurant that was closed and dark. There were deer on the road, and once, as we passed through a murky section of forest, we saw the pale faces of children waiting to cross. “What are they doing out at this hour?” “I don't know,” Louise said. I made good time on the pine flats north of the Snowmobile Capital of the World, and I wondered what it would be like to live in a town that was the world capital of a mechanical gadget. In Rigby, we had seen a homely museum dedicated to Philo T. Farnsworth, the inventor of television, which featured displays of Farnsworth's funky assemblages of tubes and wire and, apparently, coat hangers—stuff his wife was probably always attempting to throw out, a goal Louise supported. “Too bad Mama Farnsworth didn't take all that stuff to the dump,” she said. We had the highway to ourselves, and clouds of stars seemed to rise up from the wilderness, lighting the treetops in a cool fire. Slowly, the canyon closed in around us, and we entered its flowing, dark space. The idyll ended just past the ranger station at Black Butte, when a car pulled in behind us abruptly enough that I checked my speed to see if I was violating the limit, but I wasn't. Then the car was very close, and the driver shifted his lights to a high beam so intense that I could see our shadows on the dashboard, my knuckles on the steering wheel glaringly white. I was nearly blinded by my own mirrors, which I hastily adjusted. I said, “What's with this guy?” “Just let him pass.” “I don't know that he wants to.” I softened my pressure on the gas pedal. I thought that by easing my already moderate speed I would politely suggest that he might go by me. I even hugged the shoulder, but he remained glued to our bumper. There was something about this that reminded me strongly of my feeling of failure back in Rigby, but I was unable to put my finger on it. Maybe it was the hot light of liquidation, in the glare of which all motives seem laid bare. I slowed down even more without managing to persuade my tormentor to pass. “Jesus,” Louise said. “Pull over.” In her accent, it came out as “pull ovah.” I moved off to the side of the road slowly and predictably, but although I had stopped, the incandescent globes persisted in our rearview mirror. “This is very strange,” Louise said. “Shall I go back and speak to him?” After considering for a moment, she said, “No.” “Why?” “Because this is not normal.” I put the car in gear again and pulled back onto the highway. The last reasonable thought I had was that I would proceed to Bozeman as though nothing were going on, and once I was back in civilization my tormentor's behavior would be visible to all, and I could, if necessary, simply drive to the police station with him in tow. Our blinding, syncopated journey continued another mile before we reached a sweeping eastward bend, closely guarded by the canyon walls. I knew that just beyond the bend there was a scenic pulloff, and that the approaching curve was acute enough for a small lead to put me out of sight. Whether or not this was plausible, I had no idea: I was exhilarated to be taking a firm hand in my own affairs. And a firm foot! As we entered the narrows, I pinned the accelerator, and we shot into the dark. Louise grabbed the front edges of her seat and stared at the road twisting in front of us. She emitted something like a moan, which I had heard before in a very different context. Halfway around the curve, my tormentor vanished behind us, and although my car seemed only marginally under control, the absence of blinding light was a relief as we fled into darkness. When we emerged and the road straightened, I turned off my lights. I was going so fast I felt light-headed, but the road was visible under the stars, and I was able to brake hard and drop down into the scenic turnoff. Seconds later, our new friend shot past, lights blazing into nowhere. He was clearly determined to catch us: his progress up the canyon was rapid and increasingly erratic. We watched in fascination until the lights suddenly jerked sideways, shining in white cones across the river, turned downward, then disappeared. I heard Louise say, in a tone of reasonable observation, “He went in.” I had an urgent feeling that took a long time to turn into words. “Did I do that?” She shook her head, and I pulled out onto the highway, my own headlights on once more. I drove in an odd, measured way, as if bound for an undesired destination, pulled along by something outside myself, thinking: Liquidation. We could see where he'd gone through the guardrail. We pulled over and got out. Any hope we might have had for the driver—and we shall be a long time determining if we had any—was gone the minute we looked down from the riverbank. The car was submerged, its lights still burning freakishly, illuminating a bulge of crystalline water, a boulder in the exuberance of a mountain watershed. Presently, the lights sank into blackness, and only the silver sheen of river in starlight remained. Louise cried, “I wish I could feel something!” And when I reached to comfort her she shoved me away. I had no choice but to climb back up to the roadway. After that, I could encounter Louise only by telephone. I told her that he'd had a record as long as your arm. “It's not enough!” she said. I called later to say that he was of German and Italian extraction. That proved equally unsatisfactory, and when I called to inform her that he hailed from Wisconsin she just hung up on me, this time for good. ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

He liked to write with a green fountain pen that he had a habit of raising in the air slightly after each sentence, almost as if his hand were a mechanical device. He could recite lines of Blok in Russian and then give Rilke’s translation of them in German, pointing out their beauty. He was a sociable but also sometimes prickly man, who stuttered a little at first and who lived with his wife in a manner they liked. But Marit, his wife, was ill. He was sitting with Susanna, a family friend. Finally, they heard Marit on the stairs, and she came into the room. She was wearing a red silk dress in which she had always been seductive, with her loose breasts and sleek, dark hair. In the white wire baskets in her closet were stacks of folded clothes, underwear, sport things, nightgowns, the shoes jumbled beneath on the floor. Things she would never again need. Also jewelry, bracelets and necklaces, and a lacquer box with all her rings. She had looked through the lacquer box at length and picked several. She didn’t want her fingers, bony now, to be naked. —You look re-really nice, her husband said. —I feel as if it’s my first date or something. Are you having a drink? —Yes. —I think I’ll have one. Lots of ice, she said. She sat down. —I have no energy, she said, that’s the most terrible part. It’s gone. It doesn’t come back. I don’t even like to get up and walk around. —It must be very difficult, Susanna said. —You have no idea. Walter came back with the drink and handed it to his wife. —Well, happy days, she said. Then, as if suddenly remembering, she smiled at them. A frightening smile. It seemed to mean just the opposite. It was the night they had decided would be the one. On a saucer in the refrigerator, the syringe lay. Her doctor had supplied the contents. But a farewell dinner first, if she were able. It should not be just the two of them, Marit had said. Her instinct. They had asked Susanna rather than someone closer and grief-filled, Marit’s sister, for example, with whom she was not on good terms, anyway, or older friends. Susanna was younger. She had a wide face and high, pure forehead. She looked like the daughter of a professor or banker, slightly errant. Dirty girl, one of their friends had commented about her, with a degree of admiration. Susanna, sitting in a short skirt, was already a little nervous. It was hard to pretend it would be just an ordinary dinner. It would be hard to be offhanded and herself. She had come as dusk was falling. The house with its lighted windows—every room seemed to be lit—had stood out from all the others like a place in which something festive was happening. Marit gazed at things in the room, the photographs with their silver frames, the lamps, the large books on Surrealism, landscape design, or country houses that she had always meant to sit down with and read, the chairs, even the rug with its beautiful faded color. She looked at it all as if she were somehow noting it, when in fact it all meant nothing. Susanna’s long hair and freshness meant something, though she was not sure what. Certain memories are what you long to take with you, she thought, memories before Walter, from when she was a girl. Home, not this one but the original one with her childhood bed, the window on the landing out of which she had watched the swirling storms of long-ago winters, her father bending over her to say good night, the lamplight in which her mother was holding out a wrist, trying to fasten a bracelet. That home. The rest was less dense. The rest was a long novel so like your life; you were going through it without thinking and then one morning it ended: there were bloodstains. —I’ve had a lot of these, Marit reflected. —The drink? Susanna asked. —Yes. —Over the years, you mean. —Yes, over the years. What time is it getting to be? —Quarter to eight, her husband said. —Shall we go? —Whenever you like, he said. No need to hurry. —I don’t want to hurry. She had, in fact, little desire to go. It was one step closer. —What time is the reservation? she asked. —Any time we like. —Let’s go, then. It was in the uterus and had travelled from there to the lungs. In the end, she had accepted it. Above the square neckline of her dress the skin, pallid, seemed to emanate a darkness. She no longer resembled herself. What she had been was gone; it had been taken from her. The change was fearful, especially in her face. She had a face now that was for the afterlife and those she would meet there. It was hard for Walter to remember how she had once been. She was almost a different woman from the one to whom he had made a solemn promise to help when the time came. Susanna sat in the back as they drove. The roads were empty. They passed houses showing a shifting, bluish light downstairs. Marit sat silent. She felt sadness but also a kind of confusion. She was trying to imagine all of it tomorrow, without her being here to see it. She could not imagine it. It was difficult to think the world would still be there. At the hotel, they waited near the bar, which was noisy. Men without jackets, girls talking or laughing loudly, girls who knew nothing. On the walls were large French posters, old lithographs, in darkened frames. —I don’t recognize anyone, Marit commented. Luckily, she added. Walter had seen a talkative couple they knew, the Apthalls. —Don’t look, he said. They haven’t seen us. I’ll get a table in the other room. —Did they see us? Marit asked as they were seated. I don’t feel like talking to anyone. —We’re all right, he said. The waiter was wearing a white apron and black bow tie. He handed them the menu and a wine list. —Can I get you something to drink? —Yes, definitely, Walter said. He was looking at the list, on which the prices were in roughly ascending order. There was a Cheval-Blanc for five hundred and seventy-five dollars. This Cheval-Blanc, do you have this? —The 1989? the waiter asked. —Bring us a bottle of that. —What is Cheval-Blanc? Is it a white? Susanna asked when the waiter had gone. —No, it’s a red, Walter said. —You know, it was very nice of you to join us tonight, Marit said to Susanna. It’s quite a special evening. —Yes. —We don’t usually order wine this good, she explained. The two of them had often eaten here, usually near the bar, with its gleaming rows of bottles. They had never ordered wine that cost more than thirty-five dollars. How was she feeling, Walter asked while they waited. Was she feeling O.K.? —I don’t know how to express how I’m feeling. I’m taking morphine, Marit told Susanna. It’s doing the job, but . . . she stopped. There are a lot of things that shouldn’t happen to you, she said. Dinner was quiet. It was difficult to talk casually. They had two bottles of the wine, however. He would never drink this well again, Walter could not help thinking. He poured the last of the second bottle into Susanna’s glass. —No, you should drink it, she said. It’s really for you. —He’s had enough, Marit said. It was good, though, wasn’t it? —Fabulously good. —Makes you realize there are things . . . oh, I don’t know, various things. It would be nice to have always drunk it. She said it in a way that was enormously touching. They were all feeling better. They sat for a while and finally made their way out. The bar was still noisy. Marit stared out the window as they drove. She was tired. They were going home now. The wind was moving in the tops of the shadowy trees. In the night sky there were brilliant blue clouds, shining as if in daylight. —It’s very beautiful tonight, isn’t it? Marit said. I’m struck by that. Am I mistaken? —No. Walter cleared his throat. It is beautiful. —Have you noticed it? she asked Susanna. I’m sure you have. How old are you? I forget. —Twenty-nine. —Twenty-nine, Marit said. She was silent for a few moments. We never had children, she said. Do you wish you had children? —Oh, sometimes, I suppose. I haven’t thought about it too much. It’s one of those things you have to be married to really think about. —You’ll be married. —Yes, perhaps. —You could be married in a minute, Marit said. She was tired when they reached the house. They sat together in the living room as if they had come from a big party but were not quite ready for bed. Walter was thinking of what lay ahead, the light that would come on in the refrigerator when the door was opened. The needle of the syringe was sharp, the stainless-steel point cut at an angle and like a razor. He was going to have to insert it into her vein. He tried not to dwell on it. He would manage somehow. He was becoming more and more nervous. —I remember my mother, Marit said. She wanted to tell me things at the end, things that had happened when I was young. Rae Mahin had gone to bed with Teddy Hudner. Anne Herring had, too. They were married women. Teddy Hudner wasn’t married. He worked in advertising and was always playing golf. My mother went on like that, who slept with whom. That’s what she wanted to tell me, finally. Of course, at the time, Rae Mahin was really something. Then Marit said, I think I’ll go upstairs. She stood up. I’m all right, she told her husband. Don’t come up just yet. Good night, Susanna. When there were just the two of them, Susanna said, I have to go. —No, don’t. Please don’t go. Stay here. She shook her head. I can’t, she said. —Please, you have to. I’m going to go upstairs in a little while, but when I come down I can’t be alone. Please. There was silence. —Susanna. They sat without speaking. —I know you’ve thought all this out, she said. —Yes, absolutely. After a few minutes, Walter looked at his watch; he began to say something but then did not. A little later, he looked at it again, then left the room. The kitchen was in the shape of an L, old-fashioned and unplanned, with a white enamel sink and wooden cabinets painted many times. In the summers they had made preserves here when boxes of strawberries were sold at the stairway going down to the train platform in the city, unforgettable strawberries, their fragrance like perfume. There were still some jars. He went to the refrigerator and opened the door. There it was, the small etched lines on the side. There were ten ccs. He tried to think of a way not to go on. If he dropped the syringe, broke it somehow, and said his hand had been shaking . . . He took the saucer and covered it with a dish towel. It was worse that way. He put it down and picked up the syringe, holding it in various ways—finally, almost concealed against his leg. He felt light as a sheet of paper, devoid of strength. Marit had prepared herself. She had made up her eyes and put on an ivory satin nightgown, low in back. It was the gown she would be wearing in the next world. She had made an effort to believe in an afterworld. The crossing was by boat, something the ancients knew with certainty. Over her collarbones lay strands of a silver necklace. She was weary. The wine had had an effect, but she was not calm. In the doorway, Walter stood, as if waiting for permission. She looked at him without speaking. He had it in his hand, she saw. Her heart skidded nervously, but she was determined not to show it. —Well, darling, she said. He tried to reply. She had on fresh lipstick, he saw; her mouth looked dark. There were some photographs she had arranged around her on the bed. —Come in. —No, I’ll be back, he managed to say. He hurried downstairs. He was going to fail; he had to have a drink. The living room was empty. Susanna had gone. He had never felt more completely alone. He went into the kitchen and poured some vodka, odorless and clear, into a glass and quickly drank it. He went slowly upstairs again and sat on the bed near his wife. The vodka was making him drunk. He felt unlike himself. —Walter, she said. —Yes? —This is the right thing. She reached to take his hand. Somehow it frightened him, as if it might mean an appeal to come with her. —You know, she said evenly, I’ve loved you as much as I’ve ever loved anyone in the world—I’m sounding maudlin, I know. —Ah, Marit! he cried. —Did you love me? His stomach was churning in despair. —Yes, he said. Yes! —Take care of yourself. —Yes. He was in good health, as it happened, a little heavier than he might have been, but nevertheless . . . His roundish, scholarly stomach was covered with a layer of soft, dark hair, his hands and nails well cared for. She leaned forward and embraced him. She kissed him. For a moment, she was not afraid. She would live again, be young again as she once had been. She held out her arm. On the inside, two veins the color of verdigris were visible. He began to press to make them rise. Her head was turned away. —Do you remember, she said to him, when I was working at Bates and we met that first time? I knew right away. The needle was wavering as he tried to position it. —I was lucky, she said. I was very lucky. He was barely breathing. He waited, but she did not say anything more. Hardly believing what he was doing, he pushed the needle in—it was effortless—and slowly injected the contents. He heard her sigh. Her eyes were closed as she lay back. Her face was peaceful. She had embarked. My God, he thought, my God. He had known her when she was in her twenties, long-legged and innocent. Now he had slipped her, as in a burial at sea, beneath the flow of time. Her hand was still warm. He took it and held it to his lips. He pulled the bedspread up to cover her legs. The house was incredibly quiet. It had fallen into silence, the silence of a fatal act. He could not hear the wind. He went slowly downstairs. A sense of relief came over him, enormous relief and sadness. Outside, the monumental blue clouds filled the night. He stood for a few minutes and then saw, sitting in her car, motionless, Susanna. She rolled down the window as he approached. —You didn’t go, he said. —I couldn’t stay in there. —It’s over, he said. Come in. I’m going to get a drink. She stood in the kitchen with him, her arms folded, a hand on each elbow. —It wasn’t terrible, he said. It’s just that I feel . . . I don’t know. They drank standing there. —Did she really want me to come? Susanna said. —Darling, she suggested it. She didn’t know a thing. —I wonder. —Believe me. Nothing. She put down her drink. —No, drink it, he said. It’ll help. —I feel funny. —Funny? You’re not feeling sick? —I don’t know. —Don’t be sick. Here, come with me. Wait, I’ll get you some water. She was concentrating on breathing evenly. —You’d better lie down for a bit, he said. —No, I’m all right. —Come. He led her, in her short skirt and blouse, to a room to one side of the front door and made her sit on the bed. She was taking slow breaths. —Susanna. —Yes. —I need you. She more or less heard him. Her head was thrown back like that of a woman longing for God. —I shouldn’t have drunk so much, she murmured. He began to unbutton her blouse. —No, she said, trying to rebutton it. He was unfastening her brassiere. Her gorgeous breasts emerged. He could not take his eyes from them. He kissed them passionately. She felt herself moved to the side as he pulled down the cover of the white sheets. She tried to speak again, but he put his hand over her mouth and pushed her down. He devoured her, shuddering as if in fright at the end and holding her to him tightly. They fell into a profound sleep. In earliest morning, the light was clear and intensely bright. The house, standing in its path, became even whiter. It stood out from its neighbors, more pure and serene. The shadow of a tall elm beside it was traced on it as finely as if drawn by a pencil. The pale curtains hung unmoving. Nothing stirred within. In back was the wide lawn across which Susanna had been idly strolling as part of a garden tour on the day he had first seen her, shapely and tall. It was a vision he had not been able to erase, though the rest had started later, when she came to redo the garden with Marit. They sat at the table drinking coffee. They were complicit, not long risen, and not regarding one another too closely. Walter was admiring her, however. Without makeup she was even more appealing. Her long hair was not combed. She seemed very approachable. There were calls that would have to be made, but he was not thinking of them. It was still too early. He was thinking past this day. Mornings to come. At first he hardly heard the sound behind him. It was a footstep and then, slowly, another—Susanna turned white—as Marit came unsteadily down the stairs. The makeup on her face was stale, and her dark lipstick showed fissures. He stared in disbelief. —Something went wrong, she said. —Are you all right? he asked foolishly. —No, you must have done it wrong. —Oh, God, Walter murmured. She sat weakly on the bottom step. She did not seem to notice Susanna. —I thought you were going to help me, she said, and began to cry. —I can’t understand it, he said. —It’s all wrong, Marit was repeating. Then, to Susanna, You’re still here? —I was just leaving, Susanna said. —I don’t understand, Walter said again. —I have to do it all over, Marit sobbed. —I’m sorry, he said. I’m so sorry. He could think of nothing more to say. Susanna had gone to get her clothes. She left by the front door. That was how she and Walter came to part, upon being discovered by his wife. They met two or three times afterward, at his insistence, but to no avail. Whatever holds people together was gone. She told him she could not help it. That was just the way it was. ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

You don't expect it, and yet when it does happen it seems somehow inevitable—even overdue. There is the status quo, and then its interruption; a pattern, then variation. Julia had felt a crash coming ever since they had rented the brand-new Intrepid in Cancún. What was she doing riding around in a foreign country in what was, in Mexico, a foreign car, with someone other than her husband behind the wheel? Foreign, foreign, foreign. The car had only eighteen miles on it when they plowed into a wall. The wall, made of ugly cement block, was being repainted. An elderly Mexican man was slowly brushing over graffiti, tracing atop the foul Spanish as if he were writing it himself, unwriting it, in slow motion. Julia had noticed him before the crash, had thought in a brilliant lucid flash that having sex with a new man was like tracing graffiti in order to erase it: the same motions, the undoing in the doing. And then Martin had crashed the car into the wall. The painter guided Julia gently by the arm to a neat pile of rubble, painted white, no doubt by him, to resemble curbing. Of the totalled, steaming vehicle, he said, philosophically, his brush held like a torch, “Is only a thing.” “Gracias,” she said. Martin meanwhile stormed around, swearing in English, circling the crashed Intrepid as if to conjure up a repair. He wore his traveller's pants: the legs unzipped so that the slacks became shorts. Good for climbing volcanoes, visiting cathedrals, a fabric so light it would dry overnight, slung over a shower rod. Martin's legs were muscled, hairless because he cycled, red now because he was fair and had burned. “God damn,” he kept saying. The front right wheel had been completely sheared from what Julia believed was called the “axle.” That (possible) axle had scraped a deep gouge into the pavement of the street and the crumbling painted rocks beside it, just before the front fender had met the wall. The poor painter would now have to plaster as well. Bits of yellow and silver plastic from the headlight and fender glittered in the sunshine. Atop the wall pieces of glass sparkled, too, sharp and alluring—you wanted to touch them with a fingertip just to risk getting pricked. Martin: he had no title, in Julia's life. He also was married, so Julia was his mistress. But what was he? Master, Julia thought—only Barbara Eden in her bikini and groovy genie bottle could get away with that. Julia shivered giddily, relieved to be alive, recalling old sitcoms, sitting on terra firma in the hot Mexican sunshine. An overfilled bus slowed to admire the Americans' bad luck, and Julia observed herself as if from the crowded window, a bottle-blond woman dethroned, removed to the gutter in her goofy pedal pushers and daisy-topped flip-flops. “You neck?” the painter inquired, peering down at Julia as she massaged herself. It was whiplash, she supposed. Everything else seemed fine, toes wiggling in their rubber thongs, heart beating in its ribby cage, but her neck ached. Not fatally. The flow that had constituted her life had simply been diverted. She was interested in what would happen next, but the crash wasn't a tragedy, just a glitch. A wall had popped up in front of them, like a piece of toast, like a warning shot, like a love affair. That was all. It might have been the accident that made her dwell, that night, on the dead brother of her husband, Teddy. The brother had been only seventeen when he died, ten years before Julia and Teddy met. He was therefore a ghost to Julia, dead without her having known him, haunting her life nonetheless. Not unhelpfully, she thought. If Teddy hadn't lost his brother, he wouldn't be who he was, and Julia would never have met or fallen in love with him. This ghost, named Billy, accounted for Teddy's character, for choices he'd made, people he'd befriended, places he'd gone, the man he'd become. Billy had been Teddy's only brother. Good-hearted, bespectacled, asthmatic, conceivably homosexual Billy, whom Teddy had spent his young life educating and defending. On his behalf Teddy had mowed the lawn, punched the bullies, purchased beer, chauffeured, chided, counselled, consoled. Later, it was Teddy who'd supplied the cocaine and the prostitute, the tequila and the hotel room. Billy had probably died happy, Julia thought, having gone alone to the swimming pool, shed his clothes, left his eyeglasses on the tiled edge, and thrown himself into the illuminated blue water. This, too, had happened in Mexico—Tijuana, San Diego's dark twin, the news drifting up to the States on a Sunday afternoon. It was Teddy, too, who'd gone south by bus to recover the body, to bring it and the family station wagon back across the border. In the aftermath, he had collapsed into mourning. Wretched in a San Diego psych ward, he had waited for clarity while his friends finished college, married, finagled jobs, and became parents, fulfilling their contracts as adults. But Julia's future husband's dramatic undoing was followed by an equally impressive reassembly. By the time he stepped out of the bin and back into the world, restored, he had developed an unswerving internal compass, one that hovered perpetually at moral magnetic north. Unlike his friends, he had legitimately grown up. He and Julia had met soon after that, sharing classes as students in a public-health program. Once he had fixed his gaze on her, he never lifted it. Home in L.A., two weeks after Mexico, Julia waited for a cashier at Walgreens, a pack of cigarettes in one hand, a pregnancy test in the other. Such a dumb problem, she thought, unworthy of her, interesting nevertheless. The line was moving slowly, and a party waited for her back at her house. She'd pulled away from the hoopla without anyone's noticing. It was that kind of party—raucous, sodden, oblivious. The boys were safely asleep, each with an arm around the neck of a dog who wouldn't let any drunken degenerates defile them. The girl was happily turning pages as Teddy held forth at the grand piano, thoroughly in his element and three sheets to the wind. His friends—students, other professors, secretaries, the whole democratic entourage from the community college where he taught—stayed later than Julia's colleagues from Fidelity Pharmaceuticals, the few who'd put in polite appearances in expensive black clothing and then coolly slid away for their late dates, their real deals. Even if they'd stayed, Julia wouldn't have had fun; she frequently felt alone at parties, especially her own. All those people, and no one to talk to. Martin would have been that one, and not only wasn't he there, he never would be. The Walgreens cashier didn't blink at the purchases. She'd seen worse combinations, Julia told herself: Scotch and circus peanuts, condoms and electrical tape, diapers and kerosene, any number of pathetic binaries. Outside, beneath an awning, hung an unlit pay phone, one that Julia had used a few times to call Martin. But at his end of the country it was very late. Testing for pregnancy was as close to him as she was going to get tonight. As she left the parking lot, she had to brake abruptly. A group of high-school girls, all carrying musical instruments, had bounded unthinkingly into the crosswalk, laughing, swinging their flute and cornet cases, bonking one another in the rear, strutting their pretty young bodies in the light of colored neon on a balmy Friday night. In a few years, Julia's daughter would be their age, sixteen, seventeen. Billy the ghost had died at seventeen. Julia put her forehead to the steering wheel and suddenly wept. Trooper, her vehicle was named. Most of the time, Julia felt like a trouper, too, but not tonight. The sudden stop had reminded her of the crash in Cancún. “Is this safe?” she'd asked, joking, as they climbed into a replacement car from the rental agency—a Mirage. But Martin was not in any mood to make light of the accident. He wanted to analyze it, explain how it had happened, again and again. This meant that he had to turn his attention repeatedly from the road to Julia's face, to remove his hands from the wheel to punctuate, to show the distances between lanes. “Did you see anything in the road?” he demanded. This was the first time that Julia had seen him flummoxed. It didn't suit him. She was trying to adopt the attitude of the old Mexican painter: “Is only a thing.” Nobody killed, not even particularly hurt. Money was involved, but not much; Martin was nothing if not insured. Mostly it was his youthful masculine pride that was damaged, and his annoyance served only to remind Julia that her husband was a better man, milder, steadier during disaster. If she'd died, if she'd been seriously injured, how would it have been explained back home? How to account for the active aimless sperm still inside her? All these guilty problems, unkindnesses that might outlive her. And what pitiless irony, her husband sent once more to Mexico on a gruesome errand. “Cars should be named other things,” she told Martin brightly. “The Ford Spanky. Or Wanderlust, the Volkswagen van. A convertible Picaresque, with tail fins.” “And you would be targeting what demo group?” he asked, taking a curve too fast. “The whimsical,” she said, clutching the side door handle with her right hand, the shoulder belt over her breast with her left. “Somebody should throw more bones to the whimsical.” When she returned to her house, alive and ordinary, she got rid of any evidence of Martin's presence in her life—letters, tidbits, all of it, trash in a landfill somewhere now. Only the first office voicemail remained, secured these three years in its electronic vault, the combination encrypted in Julia's private set of lucky numbers. When she was lonely, when she wanted to be reminded of why she loved him, she revisited his message and the virgin urge he'd had to reach her. On and on he stumbled, a long and lovely pratfall. Martin's daughter played the flute, Julia remembered a few days later. That, too, could account for the crying at Walgreens. She had once heard the girl play, over the long-distance line, a thin sad song in the background at Martin's Manhattan apartment. It had sounded like a professional recording. Satie, that mope. Nothing had made the atmosphere of that apartment clearer to Julia, as she stood in a radiantly warm L.A. parking lot. Martin's sadness—taken up in the daughter's perfect lonely performance. His restlessness and duty struggled in the confinement of the vertical city while Julia's sprawled in the horizontal one. Strangers in strange cars rushing by, children playing sad songs on flutes, love in its inimitable, baffling shades. Her affair seemed both random and fated; perfectly scripted and half-baked. She wasn't pregnant. The next time she and Martin rendezvoused, two months later, they rented an Intrigue. “Why not a Dullsville?” Julia suggested in the rental lot of the Denver International Airport. She laid her head on Martin's shoulder. “Those auto execs think like us,” she said, meaning Fidelity Pharmaceuticals, its reps who understood the sexy significance of names. It was Julia who'd dreamed up the name Hydra for the miracle anti-inflammatory that also softened your stool, improved your mood, lowered your blood pressure, and didn't eat away your intestinal lining. “It sounds as pure as water,” Martin had said gleefully, “but means a riot of snakes!” For the remainder of Hydra's promising patented life, he and Julia would be able to meet at exotic locales all over the world, selling their many-headed product to millions of sufferers. The future of her affair felt secure, like money in the bank or a non-generic painkilling wonder drug. “Martin,” she'd said at the gate. She loved to say his name. He covered her ears with his hands, put his lips to the part in her hair, speaking her name into her skull. In the car, she couldn't look at him—he was too much to take in. She watched the landscape fly by, plains, plains, plains, then suddenly mountains, over to the west. “You mustn't hiss,” Martin warned as they merged onto the beltway. He owned no car in New York, so he did all of the driving, jerkily and too fast. In Julia's real life she and Teddy shared fifty-fifty. They shared the driving and they shared their money. Martin pinched pennies; left ten-per-cent tips. He'd grown up poor and never lost his fear of ending up that way again. It surprised Julia to learn of the financial arrangements that prevailed at his home, the arguments between him and his wife about who would pay for what aspect of their daughter's existence. The girl was being tutored in everything—languages, dance, religion, art, etiquette, test-taking—a life the likes of which Julia's daughter would never know. Using scissors and scraps, Julia's daughter made costumes for stuffed bunnies, sang country-and-Western songs at the top of her lungs, strung shiny beads on thread, gave loving names to the kitchen appliances. Julia's family was impossibly impromptu next to Martin's, lumpy, lacking manners and vigilance and sharp facial features. Three children were too many. Martin took the global position: negative population growth. One child for every two parents. When, five years earlier, Julia had announced her third pregnancy, she'd been met with a kind of slack-jawed wonder. Her friends and relatives had suddenly realized that she might never stop having babies. But Teddy adored his children; now that the youngest was in Montessori, he had started rallying for more. His calling, this fatherhood for which he'd been in training since the birth of his little brother, had come to claim him fully. Now in his care were not only children but students, that steady parade of need, as well as colleagues, neighbors, readers of his letters to the editor. When describing their life, his and Julia's, he habitually used the plural pronoun, but Julia didn't feel as though she played much of a role. She had carried the children and she had decorated the house, but Teddy was the load-bearing member. He stayed there steady as Atlas while Julia flew away. Her salary was triple his, which was how she justified her transient relationship with her home and children, her business travel. When they cried at her departure, she promised gifts. Over the phone, she assured them that she loved them, applying many terms of endearment: “Monkey, Sweetness, Moonpie.” It was her daughter, Billie, who'd recently looked up from homework hour at the kitchen table to note in a woebegone way that she and her brothers spent more time with their teachers than with their mother. “Not literally,” Julia said. “Literally,” repeated the youngest boy dreamily, the one with the most words to learn. The Fidelity convention was in Boulder. The conference rooms were climate-controlled, the personnel identically outfitted no matter where they were—Mexican beach, European castle, Alpine ski slope. But here in Colorado everyone seemed smugly healthy, in mind and body, which made Julia crave fast food and cigarettes. She didn't want to step outside because it was too beautiful, the air so painfully clean her eyes watered. This suited Martin, who simply wanted to fuck. And it was simple fucking. Less complicated than sex with Teddy, because Martin didn't care if she had a good time or not. Teddy cared desperately, and would do anything to insure her pleasure, even if it meant sacrificing his own. Teddy had long ago discovered how to make Julia respond; it was an odd kind of power, and Julia faintly resented his possession of it. Martin, however, was a selfish lover, indifferent to her even as they mashed together face to face, chest to chest, toe to toe, and that struck Julia as a strange relief. While he labored away, she let herself daydream. “I'm pregnant,” she said when he'd finished. A bold lie. She supposed she was looking for proof of his character, support for the thesis that he was worth loving, and possibly ruining her life for. But, like the car accident months before, the idea appeared to obsess him only with his own significance. “Shit!” he exclaimed, frown lines crimping his smooth forehead, just under his thick, alarmed-looking hair. “How pregnant?” He didn't ask if the baby was his; his arrogance prevented the question from entering his head. Would her husband have been so obtuse? No. But her husband would have said something worse in his delight, tossing new names into the air—a boy's! a girl's! two of each in case there were twins! “That's what we call a forced-choice question,” Julia said to Martin dryly. “Mexico.” They suddenly wanted out of the hotel room. Blinking like bats, they each took a cellular phone underneath different manicured spruce trees on the hotel grounds and made discreet calls home to check on their families, the new false weight of their relationship sending them running to their other obligations. “Honey?” her husband said carefully, “Honey?” and Julia's heart lurched, all idiocy evaporated. He was going to say something awful. One of her children was dead, injured, lost. Or he'd found out that she was not alone. In his voice, Julia heard her punishment. She'd pushed her luck too far this time. “What?” she said, moving toward and then away from Martin, her free hand fluttering before her as if to erase something—to erase it before it even existed. “What is it?” “We're fine,” Teddy said soothingly, deliberately. “We are one-hundred-per-cent fine, but there was a break-in here at the house.” “A break-in?” “Through Billie's bedroom window. Someone came in while we were gone.” In the tone he used to calm a crying child or a churlish student, Teddy told the story. Someone—someone small—had broken and then crawled through the casement window the night before. Teddy and the children had been at Knott's Berry Farm when it happened. They'd come home to find the doors swinging in a brisk Santa Ana wind and the three floppy-eared, dumb dogs loose in the park across the street. “The fish, however . . .” Teddy sighed. In addition to the dead tetras, they had found a trail of gang insignia spray-painted on the walls, winding from Billie's bedroom to Julia and Teddy's, where the aerosol had apparently run dry. Detours of destruction had been made in every room between: the fridge unloaded, the silverware tray upended, two gas burners left on high, paintings slashed, and the sofa gutted. Billie's bedroom had been thoroughly trashed, drawers dumped, stuffed animals stabbed, nail polish poured on the floor, whiskey on the bed, motor oil on the curtains—as if in preparation for a lit match. Julia was stunned. “Who would do this?” “I don't know. I've been trying to remember if I failed anybody recently, some vengeful student.” He had no enemies, her husband, none that he knew of. Julia's mind spanned the western half of the nation, situating herself the night before—as if providing an alibi—in Colorado, in her hotel room, at the time of the crime. She and Martin, propped up on pillows, eating from a service cart. “Tell me one more time,” she said, pressing her free hand against her other ear as if to fill her mind with what he was describing. Teddy obliged. “Oh, yeah,” he interrupted himself. “This is the really strange thing. On our bed, someone laid out your underwear, arranged like it was on somebody. Panties and a bra and hose. Black,” he added. “I guess they're yours.” He didn't know because he'd never seen her wear them. One of two sets she'd bought when her sex life had drifted beyond that room; the other was on her body right now. Shame flushed through Julia, a wave so powerful she had to sit down on the grass. Her house raided, its closets and cupboards struck with ill will, a vicious bushwhacking tour of mayhem, ending, it seemed, with the flimsy silhouette on her bed. The locks had been changed already, the window covered with plywood. The claim rep had visited, and a cleaning crew was coming in the morning. Teddy told Julia that he had promised their daughter a new comforter and curtains, plush toys and books and CDs and posters. “And white mice,” he added. “Of course,” Julia said vaguely. She could see Martin, under his tree across the lawn, talking seriously but with only half his attention into his cell phone, sucking from his sport bottle of Scotch-and-water, his legs flexed—point, relax, point, relax—in a cyclist's stretch. He was always multitasking. His brain had compartments. She was in one of them. “The dogs are O.K.?” she asked for the second time, her own sport bottle forgotten, leaking on the ground. “Everything is fine,” Teddy repeated. “We're all sleeping in the big bed together.” In the end, Julia felt spared. She was shaking because she was cold, she realized, nothing more. It was November in Colorado, after all. “I love you,” Teddy said. “Tell Mommy we love her,” he called to the children, who echoed the sentiment, a three-voice chorus. Julia withheld the news from Martin. All through the long weekend, she bravely didn't mention it, instead listening to him fret over his daughter's prep-school applications, which required essays and shot records and a cumulative G.P.A. and an astronomical nonrefundable down payment, and, as if that weren't enough, there was his secretary, whom he would have to fire because her multiple sclerosis was finally too debilitating to ignore. Could he really be expected to perform her job as well as his own? He paced, he ranted, he anticipated the fallout. Stewing over these problems was aging him in ways that Julia suspected he welcomed, little worry lines at his temples and mouth, proof of his influence and manhood. Meanwhile, the chronology of the vandalism in L.A. whirled in Julia's head like a shaken snow globe, from breaking glass through eventual departure, those doors swinging in the Santa Ana wind. “December in the city?” Martin said, at the airport, already glancing over Julia's shoulder, on to his next appointment. “December,” Julia confirmed. The annual Christmas party was where they'd met three years before. She said what she always did when they parted: “This might be our last kiss.” And he looked at her, as always, with warmth, knowing that he would not have to extend the benevolence longer than this momentary farewell in a public airport. “Is only a thing,” Julia told Teddy, recalling the Mexican painter as she regarded their belongings. “Well, several things,” her mild husband had responded, standing amid the wreckage. But he wasn't as aware of things as Julia was, and when she returned home she had to revise the list he'd made for the police and State Farm, enumerating the strangely modest items that the thieves had taken, the list oddly long. And odder what they'd left behind: the insignia on the living-room wall bothered Julia, a mysterious metallic-blue symbol, calligraphic and deranged, a snake in a Celtic knot, swallowing its own tail, and yet something less specific than that. How could the vandals be so talented with paint, so artful, and yet still so bent on destruction? Julia found an old can of paint, left over from the last time she and Teddy had done the walls, and, like the Mexican graffiti-coverer, she found herself tracing atop the markings, moving her arm in an approximation of what the intruders had done, following the devious twists with her own brush. But the blue spray paint bled through, the image emerging in creepy shadow fashion, like a bruise surfacing on flesh. Professional painters finally had to come and sand the wall, gouge it, prime it, restore it. It was her neighbor, Linda, who pointed out the other tagging. This was in Julia's sitting porch, where the two women looked out over the sludgy L.A. skyline, drinking wine, before their children came clamoring home from school. The vandals had not done much damage to this room, dull as it was, with rocking chairs and fringed lamps, an absence of electronics and a preponderance of books. Here, the women discussed their love affairs, Linda's former one, Julia's current one—trading off, living vicariously, taking turns. “Look,” Linda said suddenly. The smog had shifted and sunlight beamed briefly into the room, illuminating what had previously been invisible: there in the corner, eye level with a wicker shelf, a set of shining images. An empty can of spray fixa-tive had been found after the break-in. And here was what had become of that transparent aerosol: hidden pictures on Julia's walls. You could see them only in certain kinds of light, at certain angles. These, like the conversations in this room, Julia shared with no one but Linda. The thieves were girls, it turned out, fourteen-year-old gang wanna-bes. Having no vehicle in which to haul their bounty, they'd made off with backpacks—hence the portability of what was missing. They got busted just around the block a few weeks later, crawling out of another casement window with a litter of whimpering Chihuahuas in a soup pot. They confessed to everything, being girls, sobbing and sorry, one of them with a pierced eyebrow, a gold cross winking there. Everything that had been stolen—other than a few children's videotapes and some jewelry—was recovered. Even the puppies came through unscathed. Billie went with Julia to the police station to recover the family's belongings, housed there as evidence. Together, they examined the heavy plastic bags. There were objects there that Julia didn't remember owning, things she might have been nostalgic for if she'd noticed their absence. To the uninterested cop who delivered them, she said, “These are my kids' teeth.” They rattled like pills in an old Fidelity sample bottle. Why would you steal them? Julia wondered. The cop was probably wondering why you would keep them. “And you told us it was the tooth fairy!” Billie said, grinning. Teeth: parts of her children, and yet not, as expendable as the tails of lizards. Her husband had saved his dead brother's glasses, those smudged lenses that had watched poolside as the boy threw himself away. Kept now in a leather snapcase in Teddy's sock drawer. For a second, Julia grew dizzy, the pill bottle clutched in her hand—had she checked at home for the snapcase? “It's just teeth,” Billie said dismissively, already back to the bags, searching for her CDs. Another recovered object was the audiotape Teddy had made of each of the children promising to clean up dog shit if they could please please please get a dog. They'd feed and water and walk and scoop. Oh, please, Daddy, please. Three times he'd done this—not that he'd ever use their words against them. He was easily amused, her husband, charmed by simple pleasures. Such was the way with people who were on track. ” 'Please' is the beg word,” Martin had once told Julia, sniffily. He himself never used it. He hadn't taught his daughter to use it, either, a fact of which he was absurdly proud. “How about 'sorry'?” Julia had asked. On the way home from the police station, she popped Teddy's old tape in the Trooper's cassette deck and heard her children, years before, pleading, making a promise they wouldn't keep to a man who wouldn't hold them to it. “She had her affair,” Martin had told Julia, meaning his wife. It had happened before their daughter was born, and was sufficient excuse, he felt, for his carrying on with Julia. His wife, he claimed, knew about them in some corner of her self. Not the conscious one, of course; he was far too discreet. But, in his opinion, they were finally achieving equilibrium. He felt entitled. A lot of his character was marked by his confidence, his overt sense of self-worth. He was quick and decisive and very handsome—so handsome and fit that Julia often felt frumpy beside him; then she soothed herself with the knowledge that his wife was unquestionably homely. He'd married her for her mind, he'd told Julia piously. The sole photograph Julia possessed of Martin was on page 14 of the 1998 Fidelity newsletter, a legitimate document to have floating around the house. There was something misleadingly breezy in his smile. With his cleft chin, clear eyes, even teeth, he could have been a movie star. Pharmaceutical representation had been only one of many available careers. Elegant, nervous, streamlined Martin, the man to whom Julia could not fully explain her messy left-coast life. Not that he asked her to. He did enjoy hearing what Julia's therapist had determined about their affair, feeling, naturally, superior to diagnosis. With a few drinks in him, he could be enticed into skewering their colleagues at Fidelity Pharm; he possessed such an elastic and mean imagination that he caricatured brilliantly, chillingly. Julia named this trait edginess; her husband did not possess it. With edginess, however, came the edge—over which you might fall. Julia trod lightly. Concerning her husband Martin held vague and charitable views. The dead brother, the psychotic break, the lesser career, the tendency toward beer and television sports and a spare tire. Sentimental slob, he seemed to have decided, poor bastard; the community-college teaching job, in Martin's opinion, was of the “those who can't” variety. Simple logic dictated that Julia would need more, other, opposite. What Martin didn't understand, she thought, was that he wasn't really opposite. He wasn't the same as Teddy, true—and no one but Julia would see the similarity, the fact that he was, like her husband, dedicated to the life he'd made, tight as a tick with his confidence in its value. And attracted, apparently, to someone like Julia. Moreover, if Martin knew Teddy, if he were Teddy's friend, for instance, singing around the piano, playing with his children, then he wouldn't be able to sleep with Julia. Period. That was the kind of men they were. Julia, mistress and wife, alone understood the essential, mutual ignorance. Only after Martin had asked, three separate times over the phone, inflecting each of the simple words differently—”How are you? How are you? How are you?”—did she recall that he still believed her pregnant. In the aftermath of the vandalism, she'd forgotten to miscarry. On the way home from the police station, she and Billie sat, stuck in traffic. In the pile of recovered loot, Billie had found her old key ring. A real ring with real keys that she had collected as a toddler: skeleton keys, old house keys, skate keys, luggage keys, any random key that was no longer of real use. Having a key ring made her feel like one of the big people. She'd gone around unlocking everything, dishwashers and kittens and tangerines. “Some of this stuff isn't mine,” Billie said now, shaking the set. She showed Julia a baby-bottle-shaped eraser token that, on closer investigation, proved to be a small pink penis. And there was a silver key, thick, square, with the instruction not to duplicate it on one side and the number 818 on the other. Eight hundred and eighteen was the number of the hotel room that Julia and Martin had shared in Cancún, in September, back when they could have accidentally made a baby. This couldn't be that key, because that key had been a card—two cards, actually, one for Julia, one for Martin, kept as souvenirs, then discarded with all the other evidence of her love affair. Discarded in case she was killed, discarded in case someone was charged with investigating her life after it was over. In case she had the power to ambush her husband and children from afar, the power held in objects, mute and inscrutable things. “Do you think you could find the lock, if you wanted to?” her daughter asked. “Doubtful,” she said. “I bet I could find it,” Billie said. Julia looked at the girl. At the station, one of the cops had stared at Billie, running his appraising male eyes up and down her slim body before casting a glance in Julia's direction. Julia flashed back to the odd arrangement of underwear on her bed, the seeming import of it, in the topsy-turvy house—a message, if someone cared to receive it. Billie, scrutinizing now the third of the mystery objects on her key ring, a long, old-fashioned brass key with something etched on it, announced her findings: “Sally Cummins. I know her.” It was one of the fourteen-year-old thieves. “You know her?” “I know her.” “How could you know her?” Julia asked. But Billie wasn't going to say. She gazed defiantly into her mother's face. She resembled her father, with only one obvious feature of Julia's, her slightly wide nose. Her nostrils flared now, almost imperceptibly, the breathing flex of will, like a thoroughbred's just before its race. If traffic hadn't shifted at precisely that second—brake lights flashing off, movement, horns—Julia might have been able to get her talking. But the moment passed. Her daughter's secret was safe, Julia thought, and so was hers. She loved a man who was not her husband, a situation against which she was ceaselessly building a case, collecting data that proved her own mistake, only to neglect it, disassemble it willingly again and again. Soon she would have to have an imaginary miscarriage or abortion. Either way, she had to undo what she had done, even if it was only in Martin's mind that she had done it. There was Martin—whose existence often felt invented, as if Julia, like a child, had dreamed up an imaginary friend with whom to share her life, this man she loved who lived strictly separate from the sunshine and shimmering asphalt around her, who had yet to be notified of the nonexistent fate of a nonexistent fetus—and there was her now teen-age daughter beside her, whose former voice promised on tape to clean up after the puppy she dreamed of owning. And there was Martin's unseen daughter and her dooming superiority on the flute, and those girls who'd nonchalantly carried their instruments after playing them at a high-school concert one night when Julia had imagined that she was really pregnant, and then there was the strange girl named Sally who'd crawled into her house, uninvited, to steal and ransack and mark. I know her, Julia would remember her daughter saying, whenever those transparent images left on her sitting-porch walls reappeared, ghostly whisperings—Pssst—in the rare right light for many years to come. They would outlive her children's childhoods. They would outlive her puzzling love for Martin. They were outlines of hearts, strangely enough, something that any girl, good or bad, might idly draw, sloppy valentines to remind Julia of other lies she believed. ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

Short story about a modern cowboy who courts a young teacher and lawyer by bringing a horse to town. Chet Moran grew up in Logan, Montana, at a time when kids weren't supposed to get polio anymore. He had it before he was two, and his right hip never hit in the socket. When he was fourteen, he started riding spoiled and unbroke horses. The rancher left him a truck, and one night he drove the snowy road to town. He drove by the school, slowed, parked on the street. A light was on at a side door and people were going inside. A lady or girl stood at the teacher's desk. She wrote "Adult Ed 302" and her name, Beth Travis on the board. She began to talk about the state and federal law as it applied to the public-school system. At nine o'clock, the people thanked Miss Travis. Chet felt he should explain himself. He learned that she took the class and had no idea the drive to it would be as long as it was... Tuesday, he saddled one of the horses and rode it into town. At the school, he tethered the horse to the bike rack. When class was over, he asked "Can I give you a ride to the cafÈ? ." "Oh, my God," she said. "Don't think about it." He held her briefcase tightly against the pommel and couldn't think of anything except how warm she was, pressed against the base of his spine. Thursday night he drove the truck in. A tall man stood behind the teacher's desk. Chet left and drove nine hours to Missoula. He pulled up at her office just as Beth Travis's Datsun pulled in. . "I came to see you," he said. "I meant to tell you Tuesday, I'd asked for a replacement," she said. "I don't mean any harm," Chet said, and climbed back into the truck and started the engine. She could find him if she wanted. But she wouldn't. That was the thing that made him ache. View Article Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

Drummond opened the shop every morning at seven. “Next week’s your birthday,” Drummond said. Shortly after his dad died, Drummond had started bringing Pete to the shop. He guessed that his wife, free of the boy, had discovered she liked living without the burden. Drummond missed his wife tremendously. Drummond told him. “Jesus Christ was brain-dead. Sometimes your illness tells you things, Pete.” The boy didn’t answer. The hour for the appointment with the social worker approached. The woman who walked in the door couldn’t have been much older than Pete. “So, Peter, I’m from Keystone, a halfway house in Fremont.” “Nothing’s been decided,” Drummond assured the boy. “No,” Pete said. “No,” Drummond said. “Stay here and talk to this lady.” The cowbell on the door clapped, and a young mother eased a tandem carriage across the threshold. “What’s your husband do?” Drummond pulled a photo off the wall. “That’s Raymond Chandler,” he said. A gleaming Streamliner rested on his desk. Drummond returned to his son and the social worker. Pete’s lips smacked grotesquely and he stood up. “Is that typical, that kind of talk?” the social worker asked. The boy saw faces disintegrate before his eyes. Drummond taped a sign on the door and locked the shop. “I decided against a halfway house.” “I love Seattle. I ran into John Denver in the street,” Pete said. Drummond let the conversation blow away in the rain. As they were crossing Bell St., the boy knelt down in the intersection. Suddenly he made the sign of the cross, rose, and resumed walking. “Your birthday’s Monday. Any idea what you’d like?” His wife would probably call home on Pete’s birthday. They had eloped during his senior year. She had never had a real honeymoon or even a real life. “Monday, I’ll take the day off. We’ll do something, just you and me. You’ll be twenty-five years old.” View Article Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day.

Get immediate access to this article for just $1 a week by subscribing now. Short story about the narrator’s crush on her friend, the Object. The narrator, Calliope, realizes, throughout the course of the story, that she is a hermaphrodite. When the Object, a freckly, red-head, transfers to her school, Calliope’s own desire alarms her. She can’t speak when the Object one day asks to shares her book, she spends nights at home in her bathroom just thinking about her love. As school ends, the two girls become friends; they spend long days at the pool together. Calliope is mesmerized by the darkening of the Object’s freckles, the ease with which she throws her hair back, the way her body fits into her bikini? At the end of the summer, the Object invites Calliope to spend time with her at her summer house. The Object’s brother, Jerome, displays an obvious interest in Calliope, while a handsome neighbor, Rex, shows interest in the Object. The foursome go out one night, pitch a tent in the woods and smoke and drink together. Soon Rex and the Object are kissing, and, as a form of revenge, Calliope allows Jerome to kiss her. As Jerome touches her, Calliope remains completely still. She realizes that here is the fine red hair and freckles she’d spent so much time admiring, but they are on the wrong head. Calliope keeps a constant eye on the other make-out session. She allows herself to slip into the body of Rex, so that she is the one kissing the Object. She realizes suddenly, though, that while she was off inhabiting Rex’s body, Jerome has pulled off her overalls. Before she can wake up from her drunkenness, Jerome tugs down her underpants and comes inside her. Calliope gasps. For the first time she clearly understands that she isn’t a girl but something in between. She knows this from how natural it had felt to enter Rex’s body, how right it felt. Jerome doesn’t notice. He pulls out, lies down and smiles with the smile of a boy, who, on a summer night, has gone all the way? The next day, the Object is furious with Calliope for acting like a slut, and having sex with her brother. The Object goes out and spends the day with Rex, and Calliope spends the day alone. Late in the morning, Calliope goes back to her room to lie down and Jerome shows up. He begins to make out with her, and, after going through the motions for a bit, she tells him to stop, that she doesn’t like him like that. Jerome, insulted, walks out of the room quickly Not until late that night does the Object return to the house. She slips into the bed she shares with Calliope, and within minutes, falls asleep. Calliope waits ten minutes or so, and then, as though tossing in her sleep, rolls over so that she can watch the Object. Gently, she pulls the covers off her. The Object doesn’t stir. Her chest rises and falls with her breath. Slowly, trying not to make a sound, Calliope moves closer. She lifts up her shirt and gazes at the Object’s naked belly and, finally, with a kind of woefulness, bows her head and kisses it. Calliope then hooks her fingers in the waistband of the Object’s underpants and begins to slip them off. Just then, the Object lifts her hips, very slightly, to make it easier for her. This is her only contribution The next day, the two don’t mention what happened. Later, though, sitting on the porch swing drinking lemonade, the two begin making out again. After a while, they hear a creak on the porch behind them and find Jerome is gazing down on them on the Object’s bare legs lying in Calliope’s lap. “You’re lucky I’m such a liberal and freethinking type of guy, he says. “Most guys wouldn’t be so happy to find out that they’d been two-timed by a lesbian with their own sister. It’s sort of embarrassing, don’t you think?” Calliope jumps up and hits Jerome in the face. Jerome falls and Calliope climbs on top of him to hit him again. With a roar though Jerome rises up, and sends Calliope backward. Calliope runs off the porch and across the lawn, Jerome chasing behind her. As she looks back to check on Jerome, she hits a tractor dead on. She is spun into the air and knocked out cold When Calliope awakes later, it is in the back seat of an unknown automobile. She turns her head and looks up and sees a beautiful sight. She sees the Object’s face from below. Her head is in her lap, her right cheek is flush against her stomach. The Object begins sobbing when she realizes that Calliope is alive. She presses her wet face against Calliope’s and, for the first and last time, they kiss. The Object stays behind as the doctor takes Calliope into his room. Calliope reaches into the air for her friend as she is carried away. The doctors check Calliope’s body. They take off her underpants. The doctor bends closer, mumbling to himself. The intern, rather unprofessionally, raises one hand to her throat and then pretends to fix her collar. Calliope thinks to herself that Chekhov is right. If there’s a gun on the wall, it’s got to go off. In real life, however, you never know where the gun is hanging. In the emergency room, there was no smoke, no gunpowder smell, absolutely no sound at all. Only the way the doctor and nurse reacted made it clear that her body had finally lived up to the narrative requirements.

The attorney, Peter Mathews, drives down to Hampton County Jail to visit his client, a young burglar named Georgie. As Mathews steps into Georgie’s cell, Georgie begs him to protect him from another inmate, Brand, who has threatened to break his fingers. Brand is sitting in the cell with a tall, attractive woman who is talking to him and using tarot cards. Mathews speaks with his client briefly, and then leaves, promising to move him to a cell farther away from Brand. As Mathews walks out through the jail chapel, he feels depressed and craves a drink. He says hi to a nun, Sister Sophia, and then notices the pretty therapist from Brand’s cell. Sister Sophia begins nagging the therapist for playing "cosmic Monopoly," for practicing "diabolical superstition." The therapist argues with Sister Sophia. "It’s a therapeutic device. It relaxes them." Mathews follows the therapist outside and asks her to go out for a drink with him. The therapist, Amy, says no several times, but then finally agrees. Inside the pub, Amy tells Mathews she doesn’t drink, but then, finally, at his insistence, downs several Margaritas. In her drunkenness, she reveals that she is a failing actress and that she doesn’t like to drink because it interferes with remembering her lines. Later, at Amy’s house, they lounge on the sofas and drink scotch, tequila and margaritas. Amy tells Mathews a story about herself, bashfully calling the drug and alcohol rehab she went to a spa, though Mathews, having been to enough rehabilitation programs himself, sees right through her lie. She describes how at "the spa," a clairvoyant correctly revealed to her that there were two men in her life: a mediocre husband, and a mediocre lover. A couple months later, Amy’s husband discovered the recording of her session with the clairvoyant, and he divorced her. Mathews listens to the story and gets the impulse to kiss her and hold her. Instead, he draws his hand back and whacks her. The hit stuns her, but she doesn’t turn in anger. She says quietly, "I guess I deserved that." "I guess you did," Mathews said. His voice is cold and stern. He takes her by the hand and leads her to her bedroom?In the morning, when Mathews comes back from the bathroom, Amy is quietly crying. He had forced her to drink. Why had he done it, she wants to know. Mathews dresses in silence. He wants to reach out to her, to apologize. Instead, he walks out of her house.Mathews writes his brief the next day and then stops by for happy hour at a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall. He doesn’t call her that day or the next. A couple weeks later, he attends a performance of "Cymbeline" at the Community Theatre in which Amy is starring. As Imogen, though, Amy looks tired and blowzy beneath her makeup. She does apparently forget her lines at several points. Mathews feels ashamed of what happened, and has to keep reminding himself that she probably can’t see him in the darkness. In a better world, he thinks, he might have been her friend. They might have found themselves together in a rehab and had some fun’He does see Amy once again before the winter is over. He sees her in a small bar in the company of a man somewhat older than herself. Amy doesn’t hold anything against Mathews. Mathews wishes him well. Seeing her again "provides him a rush from a pump, a hit from the daily grip of regret and loss. " He makes a toast to her. He touches her glass merrily and says, "Break a leg, Amy."
